The journey was both strange and unexpected… It came out as random trains of thoughts and actions. Here is where I began: Nests: Knotting, binding, layering, clusters, bulbous, delicate centers, interlocking, vibrating into place. Trial and error, materials surrounding you, making good. Creating a safe space, repetition, container, discarding what’s not necessary, feeling safe. Finding comfort, creating hollows. Strength. Constellations, gathering, providing structure, creating a protected space, shelter, security, mother, life. Vulnerability. Today I feel vulnerable, not for myself, but for my eldest son who is taking his SATS exams. I revert to type gosh I’m so bloody English I’ll have a cuppa. Feeling comforted – feeling safe – feeling satisfied. I come back from dropping my youngest son off at school. I then found myself wandering into my garden and watching the birds, I search for a nest. I then search for a place to hide myself. I sit underneath my gorgeous mahonia bush. I feel a bit of a prat as there are builders next door. But hey, no one can see me in my secret nesting spot. Here, right now, is my nest for the morning. A thought A nest, as an object, is the culmination of a strange improvisation whereby a creature (be that animal, human…) undertakes a process of knotting, binding and layering organic materials in order to create a protective space for itself and its off-spring. Nesting – feeling safe, feeling comforted, feeling as if you’re back in the womb. Giving my womb to another human – nesting, nurturing, creating a space within myself for another. Feeding, opening, giving, receiving, creating a container. Protecting I return to thinking of my son I want to protect him. I sit and send him my energy. It’s 10am he’ll be starting his paper now. I get out from under the bush, my ass hurts. Lunch! Given that the clitoris develops from a homologous set of tissues in the embryo, and it’s supplied by equivalent nerves to the penis, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the neural and chemical mechanism of clitoral erection is exactly the same. (Alice Roberts The incredible unlikeliness of being 2014, pp. 247) My lunch looks up at me and opens up like an inviting vagina… How very odd. My motherly tendencies today have manifested as a tasty looking vagina. I go and place it in my ‘feeling comforted space’. That feels better. Not sure why, but it does. Back to the questions nest/nesting/behaviour. Sitting in my ‘feeling comforted space’ I realise that feeding my face feels extremely comforting. Food nests provide a vessel in which food can be given and consumed. Necessity turns into pleasure. I LOVE EATING. I begin to think about vaginas again and mouths… This safe place is a very strange place indeed. Being jawless, agnathan fish are somewhat limited in what they can eat. Early jawless fish were filter feeders, but modern lampreys have developed a particularly repugnant approach to dining. They are parasitic blood-suckers: they latch on to their victims with their round mouths, full of sharp teeth. (Alice Roberts The incredible unlikeliness of being 2014, pp. 79-80) This feels like a pretty repugnant way to dine sat in my bush (excuse the pun 😉) I suck my beetroot like a agnathan fish. This safe place is a very strange place indeed. Nests I come back to your quotes Alice. In his book ‘The Eyes of the Skin’ Finnish Architect Prof. Juhani Pallasmaa writes that 'Touch is the sensory mode that integrates our experience of the world with that of ourselves.’ (2012: 11)I begin to think of the mouth as a sensory surface which allows us to experience the world. Time to go I leave my nesting place to go and let my friend’s dog out. I am struck by the way she seems to nest, she finds a spot, she nestles down and then she proceeded to decapitate her toy giraffe and leaves it headless. Perhaps she knows about the agnathan fish too???? She certainly has sharp teeth. I notice how she uses her mouth to experience the world. Feeling comforted – feeling safe – feeling satisfied. She clearly feels comforted, this is her safe space. Today, Rae and I found a safe space to nest and to feel contented, and we both found a way to do this through our mouths… Shit, it’s 1: 30 gotta go I’ve got a meeting at LCB depot about The LAB. My day changes. My hidden nest at home feels like a very long way away.","mood":"lowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidmidhighhigh","lowCount":14,"midCount":9,"highCount":2,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":23,"file":"kerry responses/Day 16 response KF I am a beautiful 'me' Lepidoptera","title":"Day 16 response KF I am a beautiful 'me' Lepidoptera","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:06:25","text":"Occasionally, the DNA copying process involved in reproduction may go wrong.

Society as murmuration? Living as murmuration? Responding and working together as murmuration? A thought: Could we imagine that our thoughts and actions are part of a huge dance. This dance moves and sweeps like a starling murmuration. We can move, adapt, change direction, but we are always in accordance with the rhythm of our own live-living. And, like a Klein bottle, our intersecting selves (both with our self and with our other), we are continuously moving along a Möbius pathway, responding to the rhythms around us. Dynamic relationshipsSometimes at the culmination of the experience, the drama appears for itself. It is seen. Not actually, if that means corresponding to a sense impression striking the body’s visual apparatus. Actually: as in in act. This appearing of the drama of an experience’s self-enjoyment in the act is the semblance. Say you catch sight of a mouse out of the corner of your eye. You don’t so much see the mouse as you feel the arc of its movement with your eyes. You feel the movement continuing out of the immediate past when it was just outside your visual field, coming in. If the movement is felt to be toward you, the feeling of the immediate past includes the immediate future of your movement taking off in the opposite direction. You don’t actually see the vector of the mouse’s movement, or your own. You immediately experience the dynamic unity of the event mouse incoming, you outgoing phasing forward in the form of a felt line of approach. This direct perception of the arc of an event gathering up its immediate past scurrying it forward toward an immediate post rodent future is an example of semblance. (Brian Massumi Semblance and Event. Activist Philosophy and the Occurrent Arts 2011: 17)What is your Lift? Positivity trying to see, feel, experience the world as a dynamic event. Feeling the arcs of the world and allowing them to lift me up and out of myself. What is your Drag? Negative thoughts, negative people, inability to let things go they become rather like a destructive mouse! They creep up on you. You catch them out of the corner of your eye and they become entangled in your dynamic unfolding into the world. These become the edges Cliff Still was talking about. Like the little ant who cuts herself walking across the edges, these negative thoughts create sharp edges. What is your Thrust? To be better, to be good, to be kind, to always be the best you can possibly be. To keep listening and feeling my way around the Klein-shaped world around me. What Grounds you? Edges! Neil and my boys ground me. My Mum. My friend Mark. My 42 years of living grounds me. My fear of losing the ones I love. My ability to read people and to read the world ground me it is not always a good place. But, you can have hope and that hope gives energy back into the planet. How do you keep afloat or in flight? I can use these words of wisdom from Mahatma Ghandi in order to stay afloat: A man is but a product of his thoughts. What he thinks he becomes. Be the change that you want to see in the world. Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. Change yourself – you are in control. See the good in people and help them. Without action, you aren’t going anywhere. Take care of this moment. Be congruent, be authentic, be your true self. Continue to grow and evolve. I fly because I want to and because I can! I am a beautiful ‘me’ butterfly! What propels you forward? My huge heart. My ability to adapt. My ability to change direction and focus on what resources I have within me. The fact that I am loved and I know that I am loved. The fact that I can feel the arcs of the world.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhigh","lowCount":16,"midCount":7,"highCount":5,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":27,"file":"kerry responses/Day 15 response KF I see you Alice.

I have been lucky enough to have the gift of nurturing two beautiful sons, and, having been nurtured back by them and by my husband in very different ways, I am currently attentive to how complex and wonderfully strange our relationships are with other human beings. Attention for me right now is noticing the small things that pass between us. A quick, kind glance. A smile that appears at an unexpected moment. A little hand that takes hold of mine when I’m not expecting it. A knowing glance to a shared frustration, which arises from a silly argument… Being attentive to the energies and rhythms that lie just underneath the humdrum of the everyday helps me to notice the quality of my feelings for those I love. Acceptance I find myself thinking about how best to accept these little moments of attention? I am trying to consider the small things in life as little gifts, which might otherwise become concealed by the routine of the everyday. These are things to notice and to accept. However, acceptance carries its own set of challenges. To be able to accept these gifts, I have discovered that I have to try and find meaningful ways to gift myself the time and space to do it! This has meant making significant and life-changing decisions. Appreciation In order to understand such energies and the rhythms of our complex relationships, I think it is important to value the magnitude and inherent difficulties of being with others. Paying attention is a portal – it provides a gateway towards being able to accept certain things about each other. Appreciating that relationships are forever changing and being changed by our reactions, and that these energies are both strange and incoherent, is a further step towards transformation. Affection Strangely, affection feels like the least significant for me in the context of the 5 A’s. Is affection a result of appreciating the above A’s perhaps??? I want it, and grave it, but somehow seeking affection is more of a product of ones own insecurity. If I am to follow the notion of noticing the unnoticeable, affection becomes a by-product… AllowingRight now, this feels extremely important. Allowing myself to be… Allowing others to be… Allowing, in all of its guises, feels like a meaningful path towards a deeper transformation on both a personal level and in terms of my relationships more generally.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidhigh","lowCount":13,"midCount":3,"highCount":3,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":30,"file":"kerry responses/Day 11 response KF","title":"Day 11 response KF","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:05:55","text":"We all come out from between our mother's legs.

Hey sweet lady, these last two daily tasks have slightly knock me off my feet. I’m sorry they come together. Time has been restricted too. I’m not sure how to separate them. I live away from my family, and see them collectively only a few times a year. They all live in Suffolk (and surrounding areas). I am the only one who lives away. In the last two weeks, both my Mum and Dad have been here to visit me, on their own, without their respective spouses or my siblings. My parents divorced when I was 9, it was not a good time, for anyone. I miss them both terribly. I have missed them both terribly since I was 9. I still miss them terribly. I miss that they have not been together for the past 34 years, and yet I am thankful that they are not still together. I also feel blessed to have had my step-father Peter in my life for the past 34 years. How can love be divided yet so strong? Last Thursday my Mum came to stay we went shopping and we laughed like two teenage girls. I looked at her skin, her eyes. She is utterly beautiful. I wanted to scoop her up, bottle her and keep her with me forever. She is ‘the’ most powerful, strong, determined, loving woman I know. I think of her late Mother she was not a maternal mother. My Mother was carried, but I sense that she wasn't carried as I was does this seep through into the foetus? Do we know we are loved before we are born? It was clear that my Grandmother was lonely, my Grandad wanted kids. It was 1950 my Mother became the first of 4 children. My Grandmother worked in a bank. Pictures of her depict her as a very glamorous, handsome woman. My Grandad was working class. He looked after her and their 4 children. My Grandad was fierce as a father. I sense that my Grandmother did not nurture my Mother as my Mother nurtured me when I was a foetus. They have left a mark on my Mum. It’s not outwardly visible, but is seeps through her eyes and skin if ever she talks about them. This has also made my Mum into a fighter my Mum ‘is’ a fighter. My Mum is also fierce. She had to be. Women have to be fierce. Yesterday, I spent the day with my Dad. We went to Nottingham Arena to see Professor Brian Cox give a lecture on space and time. He discussed Einstein’s theory of relativity, he talked about quantum physics. I held my Dad’s arm, we ate nachos and chilli and laughed, we talked about the meaning of life, the magnitude of the known universe, politics and evolution. We stayed up until midnight. He is the most caring, soft, intelligent, loving man I know. I was within both of these individuals I materialised as an astonishing combination of his sperm and her egg. I was, am, in-between, yet part, and an extension of, these two individuals. Perhaps there is no such thing as an ‘individual’. We never, have never, will never, be on our own because we are the matter and substance of a lineage of cells, which are made up from a lineage of humans, which are part of a lineage of matter from the universe? And yet, this lineage is treated so differently in different parts of the world. How can that be possible when we all start out the same way? At what point in the lineage of time did women become dominated by men? I am struck by the documentary you shared. Perhaps my Grandmother would not have survived in Senegal? I am lucky to be a woman living in the west. I feel small right now I feel like metaphorically crawling back into my Mother’s womb. My Mother can’t imagine this My Grandmother’s cells are not of actual matter anymore. My Mother’s Mother is but a thought, an old life represented in the skin of another. Does that make me another representation of my Grandmother? Is that why I can see her seeping through my Mum’s eyes and skin? Does this make its mark on me. What mark does that leave on my off-spring? Do women seep through time together. I find the inequality of the women in the documentary you shared difficult. I have also been thinking about you, about your project, about the gifts you have offered us as participants. Gifts of attention, acceptance, appreciation, affection and allowing. Today I am feeling quiet. Today I am feeling a bit different about this process. The above image is for you. I stole it from the internet but I gift it to you as a sign of my solidarity with you, and as an image of how I feel connected to you and the world right now. I also wanted to offer the following from Elizabeth Grosz’s 'Volatile Bodies. Towards a corporeal feminism’ 1994, pp15: The female body limits women’s capacity for equality and transcendence; it is a hindrance to be overcome, an obstacle to be surmounted if equality is to be attained. Many feminists within this category see a conflict between the role of mother and that of political or civic being.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":13,"midCount":8,"highCount":8,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":33,"file":"kerry responses/Day 14 response KF planetary musings","title":"Day 14 response KF planetary musings","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:06:08","text":"Things that are a definite yes for me: Through a love of all that is natural and a certain purity of spirit that keeps Virgos self-sufficient and self-contained, at least on the surface.

You seek to be unique and original, and you do your best to avoid bias and prejudice. Social status is less important to you than belonging to a group of diverse personalities. Your identity, in fact, is somehow linked to a larger unit than yourself. The friendships you establish are crucial to your development. You can lack focus and be indecisive as a result. You tend to go through periods of intense highs when you are excessively optimistic. These periods are so marked that they seem to be unnatural and a fall seems to be inevitable. You are naturally trustworthy, and you don't have much patience for those who don't show respect for others, who take foolish risks, and who lead disorganized lives. Some pay too much attention to what everyone else is doing, and lose touch with what they really want to do. You are a philosophical sort, interested and curious about the world, other people, and perhaps different cultures. You can be extremely restless and discontented if you don't have a definite goal in mind.

She lacks firmness, and can be a sucker for a sob story! She likes to live in a dream, in the world of imagination, and can hope so much that reality checks can be brutal. She likes travelling, movement, change. She likes contact and is open to other people. Mental affinity in her relationships is paramount. She is good at compromising and always tries to put herself in others' shoes. Some mental laziness. You are not very quick to speak or communicate, especially in childhood, as you need to develop trust in your own abilities to express yourself. You make an excellent confidante--you are very discreet and secrets go into the vault. You prefer not to focus on facts and learn best when ideas are presented visually, emotionally, or imaginatively. She likes to discuss, likes polemic. She has good judgment and is determined. She is a worker and has lots of energy. She has a lively intelligence and goes to the heart of things. She is enthusiastic, incisive, and energetic in thought and speech. She has a great sense of observation and quickly grasps the situation. Their appeal lies in their dedication, their willingness to work on the relationship, and to make the relationship work in real terms. You tend to focus on a person's unique qualities -- those traits that make him or her stand out -- as the most attractive. They are quite sensitive in love -- even insecure -- and this reserved, loner-like quality is part of their appeal. They prefer to play it safe in their relationships, and they need to be confident that you like them before they make a move. They aim to please, and are easily intimidated by your experiences. She is very devoted, does not show emotions: she and doesn't always let herself go, either through fear of ridicule or through fear of not being loved in return as much as she loves. She is therefore sometimes too undemonstrative. May give off the sensethat her love is not for free. Caring but worries that she is not exciting enough. Carefulwith money. She might lack self-confidence and her ideals are not easy to achieve. Feelings of being used or deceived may come up.

Although they can be a little hard-nosed and critical at times, they rarely resort topushing others around. Still, an annoyed Mars in Virgo native can be difficult to bearound! Arouse their anger and they turn into complaining, over-critical nags. Mars in Virgo people are quite protective about their system for getting things done. Although rather humble in a general life sense, they can be quite particular about theirmethods--how they organize and accomplish their goals, mostly with work. Although they have some staying power, they can be restless and arenot given to sticking with the same projects for too long. These natives derive plenty of energy and life force from the things they do--their work, hobbies, and any kind ofprojects they take on.

Thinking about who I might invite for soup, has been particularly revealing. We live away from our families and rarely do we transgress from being a family unit, or from being with each other undertaking family life, or just ‘being’ in our home. My two boys have play dates and have the odd sleepover (once they were invited at the same time whoop whoop, which meant Neil and I actually went out, shock horror). Other than that we move, live, work, eat, breathe, cohabit as a little unit of 4. Therefore, when I began thinking about someone to invite for soup, I was a little scuppered as to whom I could ‘actually’ perform this act with in practical terms, besides my little family unit. My thoughts then turned to a family Kelly tea, where we would play games together and eat our favourite food (a good ol’ fashioned roast) and I would create some 'telling cards’, which asked questions like: What is the most amazing thing about Daddy, Mummy, Jack, Sam (D, M, J, S)? If you could ask D, M, J, S to do one thing differently what would it be? What do you most like about yourself? What is your best skill and your worst trait? etc. Tell us why you are epic? Tell us why D, M, J, S is epic? etcetera. I am going to do this! But, on reflecting a little more, I found myself wishing that I could sit down with one person in particular. I would love to ask this person some questions. Some questions that remain unanswered there are some things I wish I could tell her. Things I wished I had said things I wished, even should have noticed. This one person is sadly no longer with us physically, although her genealogy lives on in me and in my eldest son, for sure. And that is my late ‘Naughty Nanny’. So called ‘naughty’ because when we were little, and Mum and Dad would say no to sweets or naughty treats and things, little Eileen Francksen couldn’t resist spoiling and utterly loving her grandchildren. She would buy us sweeties, she would say oh here you are darling, with a smile and a wink that looked like an angel and a naughty nymph all at once. This woman’s love, should she be alive today, I believe could quite literally heal the world! She was utterly selfless and generous beyond compare. So, I am going to imagine a lunch-time dinner date with my late, great, Naughty Nanny: This is what we would do: Together we would make sandwiches using soft white bread, real butter and raspberry jam. The crusts would be cut off and they would be cut lovingly into triangles. Her soft, dulcet tones, with a gentle Essex twang, would fill the air as we would chat about what we’d been up to. She would call me Kweggie and I would every now again hug her and she would hug me back. I remember how she smelt a soft floral, almost talcum-powder type smell, which was subtle and kind. It followed her as she softly and slowly moved around. We would have numerous cups of tea, made with real tea-leaves from a pot, which had been pre-warmed. Nanny would then carefully place a tea-cosy over the pot to keep it warm. We would go into the lounge and drink tea, and after we had eaten our sandwiches, we would then munch our way through an array of biscuits, mostly of the digestive variety, which we would dunk into our tea. I would look out of the back window, towards her little garden, which at the time was situated in Woodford Green, Essex. I could see the little pond with fishes in, which was surrounded by the most beautiful smelling rose bushes. Beyond that was a secret gate that went out the field behind her house. I never really noticed the motorway, which drummed a little way away in the distance. I just remember the smell of the roses and the gate post that my Grandad (who sadly died from a heart attack when he was in his 60’s) had purposefully dislodged so that all the Grandchildren could escape into the playing field beyond. I always felt utterly safe, utterly loved and utterly protected from everything and everyone when I was at their house. After we’d eaten sandwiches and drunk tea, we would then put on the telly (snooker was her favourite) and we would keep chatting and I would listen to her voice and smile at her as we would joke and talk about all sorts of things… Regrets: She would have given you the world, if she could. She would have given you the clothes she walked in, had you asked her. She would have done anything, anything for me I truly believed this (and I still do today). She was a truly giving and wonderful lady. Unfortunately, this often got her into trouble. Nanny died when she was in her early 70’s. She found a lump but didn’t want to worry anyone. She lived with it until it was weeping and progressive. I remember cuddling her once, and her pulling away in pain. She had kept it hidden for over a year. She didn’t want to worry anyone. She didn’t want to cause a fuss. When she finally went into hospital it was too far gone. It was an open, infected wound. The cancer was eating her from the inside out and there was nothing anyone could do. She didn’t want to worry anyone. She didn’t want to cause a fuss. She thought it would go away. She kept it hidden from everyone. When she finally accepted that she was ill, it had grown and grown and there was nothing anyone could do. Nanny died from breast cancer. They could have helped her, her prognosis could have been good. She could have met all of her Great-Grandchildren. She could have met my youngest son. But, she said I didn’t want worry any one Kweggie. You were getting married and I didn’t want to get in the way of your wonderful day. FUCK! WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME? WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL SOMEONE? We could have hugged so many more times, we could have had triangular shaped sandwiches until we felt sick, we could have drunk tea until the sun went down, we could have hugged and I could have held your soft, soft hands again and again and again… But, you didn’t want bother anyone. Naughty Nanny was ‘the’ most loving person I have ever met, but she was too kind, she was too giving, she was too ready to give up her own needs for the needs of others. There are consequences to every action, even those that come from the best places, and from the best people. If I could have her back for just a moment, I would ask her why? Why couldn’t she tell anyone? Why did she place so little value on her own life? Why did she not fight to stay alive? I lost a woman who represented stability, security, and who made me feel like I would always be loved. She was my loving rock through Mum and Dad’s divorce. She knew that my Step-Mother hated me. In her own, soft way she tried to protect me when ever she could. She saw through her too she knew. If I could sit with her in her front room, just once more, I would tell her that I loved her with all my heart and that I missed her. That I missed how she smelt. That I missed her kindness, her cheeky, funny witty sense of humour, that I missed how I felt so utterly safe and loved when I was with her. That I missed her so terribly that it makes my heart ache. She would promise you the world, but she couldn’t promise to look after herself. I regret that she couldn’t love herself enough to realise her own worth. Nanny I miss you and I always will.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":18,"midCount":8,"highCount":15,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":35,"file":"kerry responses/Day 9 response KF Traction, slippage, loss","title":"Day 9 response KF Traction, slippage, loss","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:05:34","text":"I make a circle in the corn.

Will our social media landscape become a feminist landscape? I don’t think so.. I think women are going to be responsible, ironically enough, for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy categories… like the chick flick. This isn’t the most inspiring TED talk, but what fascinates me about it is the notion of data, and how this seems to be driving an epidemic of fake news, of fake stories, of our fake selves. Data, not just as statistics necessarily to run different algorithms for advertising, but data about us, what we like, what we don’t like, and how this is used to profile and drive the media. Data in this context is at once skewed because it is not representative of our whole selves. If women make up the majority of users, does this somehow suggest that we are more susceptible to being fake? Are women more likely to portray themselves as something that they are not? I’m not so sure. That feels to me like another demographic; another form of stereotyping. We are far too quick to place each other, to read the world, or to try and understand things via categorisation. Politics is sick with categorisation. It is sick with trying to fix things for a world that is divided by gender, race, religion, what we like and don’t like… My view of social media is that, even though we aren’t being profiled because of our demographic any more, as Johanna recognises, it is still dangerous to assume that our social consumption can give a true reflection of who we are. It seems to me that how we depict ourselves on social media is warped by a need to fit in, to be part of a community, which ironically drives us to post our ‘fake’ selves somehow. Surely, this goes against its overriding intentions to connect? Trump is nothing but fake peddling fake news, and yet the residents of the most powerful Country in the world has put heir faith in him (well just under half of them in actual fact)! My gut reaction is that our mediated selves are somewhat detached and removed within a social media context. Yet, I find intimacy and connectedness through a number of relationships I have that are, due to geography, mostly digital in nature. I also find myself intimately connected when my experience of another becomes enhanced or enlivened through a mediated encounter. For me, these are different sides of the same coin. However, I would say that for the most part, all of my meaningful relationships have been nurtured through ‘touch’. Quite literally being touched and feeling touched by people. I would say that my feelings of connectedness and belonging comes directly from being face-to-face with another human being. This can be extended and developed through technology, but my feelings of being in relation to another human comes from spending time with them; first and foremost in, so called, physical space. I notice that I always feel slightly lesser somehow when I have been on social media. I feel like I’m not quite achieving what I should be. I see what brilliant things other people are doing and I feel like a failure. I ALWAYS feel a bit rubbish or not quite myself when I’ve been on social media. I try to limit this. Social media makes me feel like a failure. I also agree with participant 20 that We are so distracted all the time that we are not truly present with others or even ourselves much of the time. However, social media is a fantastic place to share and engage in political discourses. I am more interested in these posts than the posts describing peoples everyday lives. My use of social media has changed since Trump and the EU referendum. _I have decided that I am a private person. I only wish to share things with people I trust, and would like to get know more intimately. I feel like you are one of these people Alice. You have given me a portal into which I can pour bits of myself, whilst still feeling safe enough to do so. This process makes me feel connected. Thank you for that Alice. I hope you are ok? I wonder how you are holding up with all of this info? Sending you a hug 'right now’ xxx 17/5/17 7: 30 pm I just had to add the following: This is what I found myself screaming to my youngest son about an hour ago in response to him repeatedly ignoring me when asked to come off of his device, and then treating me like I am some enemy who’s asked him to commit the most heinous activity ever, just because his time is up ggggggrrrrrrrrrrrr : -(Oh my God, I hate this. It’s like I lose you and you disappear into this void, your face gets lost in this screen and I can’t reach you anymore. You can’t hear me, it’s like I’m invisible to you. And then you come out all aggressive, and miserable, and you make me the enemy it’s all my fault because I’m the one who has asked you to stop playing! AAAAAGGGGHHHHH I can’t stand it when you look at me like that. It’s horrible. It’s horrible for you and it’s certainly not nice for me either. Why do you make me shout at you like this!!!!! I’m not proud of my reaction surely I’m the adult and I should be teaching my son how to deal with social media. But, at the end of a very busy day, when I just want some adult time, this is what happens!!!! I definitely have a love hate relationship with my technological world and that of my two sons.

I was 8 years old. Realising that Mummy and Daddy now lived in separate houses. Growing up in a moment – I realised that everything can change in a flash. A Mother’s love is enduringHaving ear-ache as a child and feeling the pain ripping through my body and calling for my Mum. She came! She would always come, she would always be there, she would always find a way to comfort me. I am strong Cycling my heart out to school through the howling wind and rain on an old knackered bike that weighed 3 times as much as me.

I am not wantedReaching for my Step-Mother’s throat and pushing here towards the wall and screaming at her that she will never speak about my Mother, or me and my siblings in that way ever again. I am 13 years old. I am not to blame. She no longer has any power over me. I can take action against adults that are manipulative and hurt me. I am safe Getting lost as a child in a busy amusement park. I am vulnerable Love is different to sex Cheating on my boyfriend when I was a teenager because I wanted to discover my sexuality. That sex can feel dirty and unfulfilling. I also realised how much I felt for my boyfriend at the time and how utterly terrible my actions made him and me feel. That was the first, and the last time, I ever hurt anyone in that way. We are responsible for others hurting people feels utterly hideous. We all have the potential to feel power, love, hatred, pain, pleasure we need to look after each other. I am independent and in control of my life Being dumped by my boyfriend on my graduation day in 1996, and then pleading with him not to leave me whilst on my bended knees. I am not in control. I will love, but I will love on my own terms from a position of equality and respect. I am safe Being involved in a car crash and watching the event unfold in slow motion. Life is fragile and precious Attention, acceptance, appreciation, affection, allowing Love can endure anything Finding out that my friend’s parents had been shot dead by her Mother’s lover. Humans are destructive. Love can be devastating. Being successful Achieving the award, and being presented in assembly, with the title of ‘Games Captain’ at my middle school for the 3rd year running. Adulation and success is a drug. Bully’s are powerful Confronting a girl at school who had threatened to beat me up. I confronted her by offering her my friendship – I was extremely kind and generous to her. People are full of shit. They are always hiding from something. Try to look behind what’s on the surface. Doing the right thingSigning on whilst I was working a cash job in a sandwich shop in Leicester just so I could find enough money to pay my rent and live. Doing the wrong thing to survive. Falling in love again Meeting my husband Neil I can be loved as an equal. I can love as an equal. I am important The birth of my two boys. The gravitas of parenthood. They are important. Falling utterly and deeply in love, in a new and wonderous way. I now understand my Parents’ love for me. My career is important Being torn between my career and my boys. Feeling guilty again- about dropping my kids to yet another out-of-school activity just so I can work. A career can be destructive. My family is important. I am important. I shouldn’t have to feel guilty all of the time. I have a choice. Fight or flight response Rushing to pull a young girl from the water who had fallen into a canal, while by-standers just stood and stared. No body helped – I pulled her from the water myself, with no help from anyone! I act instinctively. People either fight or they become paralyzed by fear. I am a fighter – just like my Mother. Craving success Being annihilated in my PhD Viva by a powerful woman and not fighting back. Feeling weak and mentally abused (as I did as a child at the hands of my Step-Mother).

They are full of holes. I am facing away from the house, towards the corn fields out the back. I can see a tree with an old battered wooden swing underneath it. Through the tree, and beyond the swing, I can see the yellow corn. It sways gently in the breeze. I am gently running… I am running into the corn. The earth is rough and uneven. It is difficult to run. But I can run. I am only 8 years old. The corn’s stems are hard and strong. They are anchored into the ground. They jut up out of the hard, dry earth. They try not to move as I swish past them. I hold my hands out to the side of my body, and let my hands trace across the tips of the corn. Their tips look like little heads, with hairy faces. They have spiky edges, but they feel soft on my hands. My sandals aren’t very white anymore. There are bits in-between my toes. I keep moving through the corn. I look back at the pathways I have made in the corn. I stop to look back at where I have just been. I can see a faint track where I have disrupted the corn. Some stems are slightly bent and look as if they are curved over like little old people. I make a circle in the corn. I pick up my feet and I push the heads of corn down on to the earth. I stamp my feet and bring my knees up high. The circle is small, but just wide enough for me to sit down. There are scratches on my legs. There is now dirt and bits of corn in my sandals. I sit down and look up at the sky. I hear my sister calling me. I stay sitting down. I keep looking at the sky It is blue. It looks curved. My Mother left my father that day.

On your lovely suggestion of wrapping ourselves up in our clothes, I decided to take a picture of my wardrobe in the gorgeous Saturday sunlight that little corner of our bedroom is my girlie space. I notice that my wardrobe is placed right next to the window. I can see our garden from my window. I like to look out as I get dressed in the morning. I also think about how Neil’s clothes are downstairs in the spare room because there isn’t room in our room. All of my clothes are in our bedroom. I am a nester I like to have my things close by. I’d not thought about that before. I also notice that, as I open the wardrobe, I can smell myself. I like to smell nice it makes me feel feminine. It makes me feel in control. That reminds me of one of my early years teachers when I was 6 or so, called Mrs. Wiggly (who a great name). She ALWAYS smelt amazing!!!!! I absolutely loved her she was quite scary and strict, but she was strong, fair and intelligent. She smelt feminine and powerful… Jeez, maybe that’s it? Mrs. Wiggly showed me that smelling good as a woman placed you in a position of strength and knowledge! I LOVE that thought!!!!! I wear two different perfumes. I have worn one of these perfumes for a long time, since we got married in 2003 in fact. Thought: Mrs. Wiggly unlocked my ‘smelling intelligence’, which enabled me to consider myself as an intelligent, strong woman. I like the idea that a 'smelling intelligence' has continued with me throughout my 42 years. I wonder if I smell differently now, in 2017, than I did in 2003 when I first bought my perfume? Has having children changed the balance of my pheromones? That makes me think about my wedding day. I felt extremely feminine on that day. I never wanted to be a princess bride like my Sis. In fact, I was always the ‘tom-boy’ of our family. My Mum always kept my hair short. She said it would never grow when I asked her when I was an adult. I always wanted long, thick hair. My hair is not one of my most favourite attributes. I lose my hair when I am stressed. That makes me feel utterly horrible and unfeminine. My Sister, Kat is extremely glamorous and feminine and has beautiful long dark hair. I wouldn't say I was feminine. I remember a lad once saying to me You’re kind of in-between. You’re not really attractive like a girl, but you’re pretty cool like a boy. I was in the school football team when I was 9. I was very good at most sports. I liked playing with boys (in more ways than one; -). Many of my friends growing up were boys. I wasn’t ‘one’ of the lads by any stretch. They still treated me as a girl. Although, I think my ‘sporty’ status gave me a special pass into their world. They accepted me in many ways, in ways that my girlfriends didn’t. I always liked that. That changed a little when hormones kicked in, but I still enjoyed playing with the boys. I find Trump’s and May’s inabilities to consider the complexity and diversity of human nature extremely frightening. Trump’s misogynistic views of women are catastrophic for our times. I am frightened by our current times. Where are the Mrs. Wiggly’s when you need them!!!!!!!

I can explore. I am not a boy or a girl I am me. Refusing to play with Ian and Alan after Ian told me he loved me when I was only 7. I am a girl. I am unique, adored and special. The birth of my three sisters. I am not unique. I have to share. Adults can always protect me. Getting stuck in a ‘eddy’ whirlwind in a burnt cornfield with my Grandpa ‘Umpa. Grown ups can’t always protect me. I can have anything I want. Being told this was the only shop I could get school shoes from. I can’t have everything I want. Being a good girlHiding my wellie boots in the bushes at the bus stop before school and putting on my Granny’s heeled pixie boots instead. Being a rebel. Sex is bad. Making love to my first boyfriend against my bedroom wall. Sex is good. Be careful. London is full of strangers. Moving from a village in Leicestershire to New Cross in London. Meeting my best friend Sophie and each being given a pink carnation by a stranger as we held each other and cried in Blackheath church homesick and troubled. Strangers can be kind even in London. The world is a dangerous place. Travelling across America on my own at 19years old and ending up in Yosemite park with a German and American and a Bear. I can trust my own instincts and keep myself safe. I am not ‘healed’ enough to be a mother. The birth of my son Barney. I am a ‘good enough’ mother. I cannot possibly love another child like I love my first. The birth of my son Henry. Love is expansive and has no boundaries. I am lost. Sitting on the floor and re-discovering all my sketchbooks and writings from art school and realising that the things I am searching for now, I already worked out or known. ‘The forgotten known’. I am found. Life is unfair. Travelling to Australia to hold my sister and her stillborn daughter Susie my niece. There must be something to learn from each experience however painful. I can get married because my head tells me too. My wedding in New York. A marriage that is not from the heart is not a marriage. You have to stick a marriage out for the sake of the children and everyone else even if you are unhappy inside. I am unimportant. My divorce in Nottingham Crown Court. You can choose to change things however painful and become Happier. I matter. When I went on a long walk last weekend I took lots of photos of bridges, crossings, stiles, and a ford… IMG_2664. movAnd a lot of my ‘transition points’ are also marked by house moves… 'Today I looked over the gate of my ‘old’ family ‘house'. It is set to go on the housing market this week and represents the end of my marriage and the culmination of my divorce. The ultimate social status and achievement of ‘five bedroom quintessential thatched cottage in the heart of Rutland’ has dissolved. Since my divorce, good friends of mine recently said to me that when they first saw this house 3-years ago, they thought, ‘Oh no, Alice and Alex have bought another massive and stressful project to ‘hold’ themselves together’. She couldn't have been more right. In this ‘aha’ moment I allowed myself to ‘admit’ I was living a lie, a false construct that no longer fed my ‘heart’. With a project to focus on the ‘outside’ we didn’t need to look at ‘us’ ‘inside’. With this painful insight I made the choice point to leave, turning insight into action and transit, transform. I now live in a smaller rental property in a market town nearby. But it ‘feels’ like my home. After 18 years of ‘relationship’ I at last had the insight and courage to liberate myself from my self made false constructs of ‘success’ ‘social', ‘relational', ‘economic’ status and fear. I now feel so ‘much' inner freedom and happiness with so much ‘less’. I am starting to experience what it feels like to be really ‘fulfilled’ inside rather than ‘successful’ seen outside. Inside ‘noticings'. Outside ‘trappings'. Freedom, flight, transformation. I have learnt to ‘give my feelings ‘form’ and not ‘form’ to my feelings… I look forward to hearing about your ‘aha’ moments… all gates can be opened.

But certain groups of cells survive, turning the soup into eyes, wings, antennae and other adult structures’. 'Before hatching, when a caterpillar is still developing inside an egg it grows an imaginal disc for each of the adult body parts it will need as a mature butterfly… discs for wings… legs… so on… once the caterpillar has disintegrated all of its tissues, except for the imaginal discs, those discs use the protein rich soup all around them to fuel the rapid cell division required to form the wings and the legs… eyes… genitals and all other features of an adult butterfly… ''By the end of metamorphosis certain caterpillar muscles and sections of the nervous system are largely preserved in the adult butterfly… [some] studies even suggest that butterflies remember what they learnt in the later stages of their former lives as caterpillars…’ (J, Ferris, Scientific American, 2012: 10) On Day 5 Participant 7 (a musician) wrote: 'At this point, I need to talk about thought and touch/impression. I imagine motions before actually exercising them. I play musical phrases in my fingers (sometimes moving them very slightly but often not at all).

I suppose that giving attention to someone is a form of love but often we do not unless our partner asks for it. Acceptance can be receiving love or even the loss of it, accepting that you no longer have it. As in It may not always be so… Appreciation seems too mild a term to use of love. Affection too is mild, and Allowing, well would you allow someone to love you, give them permission? These last three are not words I would normally think of in connection with love. Their opposites attention/ignoring acceptance/rejection appreciation/disinterest affection/coldness allowing/forbidding. The opposites are a lot more powerful. I suppose rejection and forbidding are the strongest terms to use in the context of love, particularly the former.

This need we may call self-actualisation’Maslow (1954) Today I invite you to analyse where you are currently spending your time and energy by generating your own Wheel of Life. As background to this: Many of you will be familiar with Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Pyramid. On this version of his diagram the concept of ‘transcendence’ is also added to the ’top'. I also feel that our ability and need to create/play/transform also sits somewhere in this same place and that these are those ‘aha' moments of shift, realisation, freedom and insight when we are in ‘creative’ flow… a musician must play, an artist must paint… a writer must write… a gardener tend… a chef cook… Similarly in ‘Authentic, how to be yourself and why it matters’, (Joseph, J. 2016): Prof. Stephen Joseph talks about the 'Eudaimonic or Hedonic’ orientated person: 'The eudaemonically orientated person values personal growth, seeks new challenges, strives for excellence in what they do and looks for meaningful purpose in their life. They set goals for themselves that are intrinsically valuable to them and part of their identity. In contrast, the hedonically orientated person seeks pleasure, enjoyment, comfort or relaxation. Because their orientations are different, they have contrasting behaviours and experiences.’ (Joseph, J, 2016: 104) in ‘Authentic’. So when drawing your 'Wheel of Life’ consider also what are the orientations of your intentions… eudaemonic or hedonic? Here are template options to print off and colour/notate then scan or photograph back into Evernote or draw your own on a piece of paper or annotate one in ‘Skitch’ online. Then make up your own 8-12 categories to put round the edge. You may wish to adapt and extend these from your THRIVE (and in the case of Participant 13, FLOURISH) Transformational Targets from your Day 15 Response Prompt. Maybe put a E or H by each category also to identify if your life is spent in a more Eudaimonic or Hedonic orientation. Some other suggestions for categories might be: Creativity. Love. Solitude. Sexuality. Intimacy. Earning Money. Fun. Recreation. Physical Activity. Property/Possessions. Personal Growth. Spirituality. Labour/Employment. Family. Friends. Learning. Helping Others. Examples: Now rate your satisfaction/fulfilment levels on a scale of 1-10 or 14 depending on what template you use with 10/14 being 'Very Satisfied/Fullfilled' and 1 being 'Very Unsatisfied/Unfulfilled'. It might then look a bit like one of these…: Then analyse how do you spend your time? How could you alter parts of your wheel to rebalance certain areas, if one area is high what are you neglecting is this still satisfying how can you make more time to generate space to expand and deepen what you need more of in your life to feel a greater sense of fulfilment… self-actualisation… freedom of choice… creativity…? As an extension exercise for those of you that want more: Try setting your watch to bleep at ten random points throughout your day over three days, note what you are doing at each time. Don’t judge it just jot it down… you might be reading… working… playing with children… arguing… then think is it of hedonic or eudaemonic orientation… then ask why… dig deep… is it because you need money… is it because you are avoiding contact with someone… because you need to look afte the family… how much is it meeting your needs… what might you look to alter… rebalance… transform…?

Prompted by the events of the Manchester Bombings today 😔… as a ‘species’ we have also seemingly coerced ‘love’ into separate waring factions of religion, power, conflict and division. A participant from my last piece, ‘Situating the Reciprocal’ said of his experience within this artwork, 'If it is a unique contribution to knowledge, then it is a unique contribution to our understanding of love.’ (‘SITUATING THE RECIPROCAL’, MR: 2016). And today perhaps of all days in the UK since July 7 2005 it seems to me ever more important to ‘map a field of connections and love’ and not ‘build barriers and walls of division and hate’. This TETTT work we are doing is important not just to academia and art but hopefully to us, our ‘species’ and planet. By our really listening and wanting to ‘hear’ each other and connect through and beyond our differences… we surely make small steps away from ‘hate' and towards a more hopeful, restorative and unique contribution to ‘love’. Peter L Natal Chart Report. pdfSo I have noticed over the past fortnight your many different ‘mappings’ of love, journeying, connection, touch, movement, out, back, between, within, beyond to include yesterday your own personal maps of connections, familial, romantic, collegial and other… Today, as a bit of ‘fun’ and in order for me to practically ‘collect’ your data, I have mapped your birth chart for each of you. This 'natal chart’, is a picture of ‘your' sky at the exact time of your birth showing where the planets were in relation to the earth and the zodiac when you were born. These charts create interesting ‘shapes’ and if you wish to draw anything more from them in terms of the ‘meaning of the positions’, on your 'temperament, patterns of behaviour, general characteristics' and the 'potential influences’ the planetary positioning might have on your life then please do so. If this is the case I suggest you look at the chart diagram, maybe reading the blurb on the PDF also and noticing what leaps out at you in relation to your own 14 days of mapping your experiences of ‘Touch’ and ‘Traction’ response. Are there any further useful traction points of cross-reference, resonance and resource in relation to your birth skies that might be worth recording? What seems to align? What seems untrue? What insights/resistances offer traction? Any more ‘aha’ moments in image, word, thought, sense, action, colour, sound, hue? What intimacy, ‘in-to-me-i-see’ to you see when your 'sky and earth’, or your 'you and I' collide? This is mine: For example in mine these are the useful ‘planetary’ musings that for me seem to some how correlate with my own ‘earthly’ experiences and reflections: Perhaps the early family life was lacking in supervision or clearly defined rules. A father figure may have been absent or distant and ineffective. You may have a glorified image of your father. Whether the image is very positive or very negative (or if it swings between these extremes), the image is not very clear or rational. Whatever the case may be, you struggle with defining who you are. You might be susceptible to being taken advantage of by others, especially by men or authority figures. You may be easily led astray by peculiar desires or self-destructive habits. You may struggle with early conditioning that made you feel tossed aside or neglected in some way, and certainly not directed or supported. You are not much scared of anything. You enjoy and embrace growth, especially of the psychological kind. You look for symbols, and read between the lines in most any situation. You are not afraid to get your hands dirty, and you are usually quick to help others--not only with mundane tasks, but also on a spiritual or psychological level. You are not a do-gooder nor are you a law-breaker. However, you are not afraid of the dark side of human nature, and you will bend the rules from time to time if you feel the need to do so. You take particular pleasure in growth and life's lessons. You are not fond of superficiality, and are generally the first to spot pretense of any kind. You are passionate and can be intense. Highly imaginative. She fantasizes frequently. She falls back into her imaginary world. Dreamlike. Your imagination is so powerful that it can be hard to trust your instincts. You easily imagine things going wrong, just as you easily fantasize about good things! You are usually found chasing a dream… or a fantasy. The former is probably the better path. You are very responsive, communicative, and curious. She likes research, investigations, inquiries. Studies well. She is fascinated with all that is unexplored, mysterious, taboo, secret, and psychological. Loves research and has a great mind. She wants to know the motivation behind what people do. Her senses lead. It is only when you get into touch with your heart and discover your true desires that you realize that sensations are merely sensations--not deeply satisfying or fulfilling. Sometimes prone to feelings of guilt about their anger, and difficulties with asserting themselves, Mars in Pisces individuals seem to go with the flow. As you have difficulty trusting in your ability to go after things that you want in a direct manner. It may also be that you have difficulty pinpointing what it is that you want, or that part of you doesn't feel you deserve it due to a basic lack of self-confidence. You fear rejection as well as criticism, and often use roundabout means to go after what you want. If you do feel resentment for giving up your power to someone else, learn to avoid giving it up unless you truly understand that you are doing it for yourself, and not for someone else. Adopting a more direct and assertive approach to life is something that you should be working towards. Values people and personal freedom most. Wants to show unique perspective or skills. Open to new methods and progress. Crafty, subtle and critical. Great tolerance and humanitarianism. She knows what's going on at a glance. She thirsts after knowledge, and is a good organizer. She is very independent, likes her freedom of action, is a non-conformist. Possesses a serious mind, sometimes wishing to be more free and breezy. Pluto represents transformations, mutations and elimination. They have charming smiles, a gentle approach with others, and an easygoing image. She will study for a long time, will be erudite. Very intelligent, an open and independent spirit, will have a connection with foreign countries. Fertile intelligence. She will leave the family home reasonably young. Likes liberty, wants a life that is out-of-the-ordinary, and certainly one that does not correspond with Mum and Dad’s. Likes studying, is open to anything new, accepts and recognizes her errors, always develops in a positive sense. Likes travel, discovery, meeting new people and knows how to appreciate them. All the leadership qualities are there: authority, sense of organization, initiative, intelligence, but also thanks to outside help. She is a fighter. Her knowledge is the result of study but also of the down-to-earth nature that characterizes her.

One specific teaching is about not carrying but standing beside another.’ (Participant 8: 08/05/17).

Bowlby (1907-1990) refers to these ‘excavations’ as ‘forgotten knowns’ and in Gestalt Therapy terms, ‘aha’ moments – rediscoveries and recoveries of parts of self. Bowlby was interested in how separation from our caregivers impacted us as children suggesting that both mothers and infants had ‘evolved’ together ‘an innate need for proximity’. Bowlby was also interested in K. Lorenz’s 1935 study on ‘imprinting’. 'Lorenz he was able to show that young geese would imprint on attachment figures in the environment within a certain critical period after hatching. Lorenz was even able to get newly-hatched geese to imprint on him and view him as a mother figure. This revealed that not only is attachment innate, but that there is also a critical period during which the formation of attachment relationships is possible. Lorenz’s research found that after a certain period (approximately 32 hours for geese), attachment was not likely to occur.’ Are we attaching, imprinting or standing side by side, co-creating, or is our encounter a form of dancing?

What have you learnt on your journey so far… (in life and in the last 21days…)… what is coming with you? ‘Wherever I lay my hat, that's my home’ Alice Tuppen-Corps, December 2016. Alice Tuppen_Corps_ for TETTT. docxWe have started and/or deepened our own relational ‘Transformational Encounters’ virtually together in this ‘Evernote’ holding space… Some of you have already started encountering each other of your own volition ‘outside’ the virtual space and spending time together in the ‘real’ world… I have also spent a a few moments with some of you, over coffee, taking photos, fixing a ‘naughty’ computer, sharing a beer, listening to some music, having a meal or experiencing a reading… You have also spend time with intimate friends and loved ones over soup… or even encountered ‘unknown' ‘strangers' or dialogued with the ‘known’ ‘estranged’, over chance meetings or through ‘awkward’ transforming conversation… Today once you have packed your bag of ‘intimate resources/objects’ if you wanted to share these with one other person other than yourself who would this ‘famous’ person from history or the present day be? Why would you choose them? What would you want to tell or share with them about you or your ‘intimate resources/objects'? What might youk want from them? When you reach your destination where would that be, where would you nest down for the day, night, week, experience together…?","mood":"lowlowmidmidhighhighhigh","lowCount":12,"midCount":4,"highCount":3,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":59,"file":"Transformational Encounters.

Areas to Transform: 1… 2… 3… 4… 5… 6… 7… Our Group Traction Summaries: 1) Participant 5 said: 'Sometimes this week I have felt a bit like you are reading my mind!! ’… others of you have said much the same… but I really think that it is ‘our’ co-related space that creates a ‘reciprocal’ synergy, potential and place for exchange.

(I didn’t fly to Jamaica). The second ’Transformational Growth' took place between August 5th 13. 00 – August 22nd 2am Sykros Island. 5 days later. (I did fly to Greece) This was a ‘Transformational Encounter’. We can choose to how to change and grow. Throughout the previous two years of my Ph. D. research I have worked with all kinds of ‘mobius strips and worlds’ to try and work out where the touch, traction and transformation points are, where I, you, the artwork, audiences enter, exit and move within the work: B5394232-17F5-442A-913C-2D0C69170AAB. pdfThese existing models are also useful: And this is an ‘art' model of my mobius in action: This is an image of my son ‘falling from the sky’ while the artist mother looks up at the plane he fell from as she simultaneously pilots the plane looking down into her garden from the sky as she stretches out her hand feeling the toy polystyrene plane resting on the grass waiting to take off. It was generated by the artist but packaged by a participant from her last piece ‘Situating the Reciprocal’ and returned to the artist. It is also the mobius strip at work… Another example of looking at Ways of doing it… Way of thinking about it.. And to go back to the start of this post to Participant 5, she went on to stay about technology: If we look at the linguistic origins of the term… cyborgian space, i. e. a space which is extended (functionally, dimensionally, aesthetically) by the intervention of technology. In this sense, it can be imagined as a space we can actually inhabit on a day-to-day basis, albeit a space which somehow amplifies our ‘normal’ way of being… We are cyborgs and that is wonderful. ’Which leads to and leaves us with Bjork and her album/app ‘Biophilia’.

Like a magpie… pick out the 'shiny things' that resonate for you… cultivate them, dialogue with them… make them your own… change their shape, colour tone, hue… I want you to take them back into your nest and add to them, reimagine them, rearrange them like ‘furniture'. Place them where you would like them to be. Sit or lay in one of the objects, look down at a view from on high and tell us what you see sea? Breathe in the air what can you smell. Taste the food.

What might your ‘noticing' and 'playfulness' return to the original author? This is your ‘Us’ story: I am 8 years old. Peacocks preen and fight, cars crash outside, a girl and a boy balance on the parapets. A note book lies on Grandfathers sheep skin rug, my toes peeping out of my sandals look as if they have been made out of snow-flakes and drops of sweet evaporated milk. A turntable with an integrated tape deck plays notes through a building with holes for windows, eyes, our first kiss, your tongue thrusting as the florescent light flickers overhead. Stray dogs, skinny and boney, a dead coconut leaf and over there, through the tree, and beyond the swing, I can see the yellow corn. My bed is painted in red with red bars around it. We painted and glued it there. Sometimes that's all any of us need big Bear. Hardly a day passes when I don't think of you. Journeying with the raindrops down the glass, being inside the raindrop perhaps. Talking about the 'strange sound world' that us hard of hearing people inhabit and then acid trip. I went round Times Square, full of hard core 'girlie' mags and film booths with men in dark glasses on high stools behind counters. I was drawn to it, but at the same time I was sick. Red Wellies. Rain Mac. Pompoms and finger-knitting were f, mother… favourites of mine. The owner of the cafe sexually assaulted me and I didn't tell anybody. Like a dog without a bone.

Where do they land? What blockages are they signalling? What encounters are they enabling? What action might your words galvanise? What dialogue can we have?

This response from Participant 11 You 'like' or you ‘fight' is particularly apt for this next stage of ’Traction’ Days 8 14. As a theme for the next 7 days I invite you to think about ‘Traction’ as a kind of ‘drawing' in… or a ‘pulling' away from… or a drawing away from, or pulling in towards… a kind of ‘adhesive friction’, between one thing, (idea, person, screen/object) and another, (idea, person, screen/object) to potentially ‘connect', ‘correct’, ‘heal’, ‘mend’, ‘overcome’, ‘relocate’ ‘reach out’ ‘pull towards 'a given ‘impetus’ or ‘advancement’ or 'desired result’… This ‘motion or potentially 'e-motion’ is as Participant 9 says often ‘Bittersweet’. Today I invite you to start to explore your own life story by writing down a narrative about an intimate encounter between yourself and another person/object/idea/place etc. that you consider to be at an ‘early' ‘threshold moment’ in your past life. Write it in the first person, like it is a story that you are re-living in this very moment – try to go with what first comes into your head… then write it down from your senses and from your heart. To do this, and as a starting point only, I draw upon the work of Narativ, www. narativ. com . Jane Nash and Dan Milne are practitioner's and contemporaries of mine who use this particular method of storytelling and one which I have experienced with them on several occasions to great affect. One of their principles is that there is a reciprocal relationship between listening and telling. And so I am inviting you to tell and I will listen… from a state of noticing and non judgement. I invite you to use their ‘What Happened’ method telling your story by sticking to ‘What Happened?’ as distinct from giving: OpinionsJudgementsInterpretationsCommentaryand resisting a description of internal processes, so avoid: I thoughtI feltI decidedI realisedetc. Instead use the idea of a ‘sensory camera’ What did you hear, see, taste, smell, touch in your ’threshold’ moment/story/event? e. g. 'It is London 1976. I am five years old. I am standing in a small school hall. I have patent leather sandals on my feet. The room smells of plasticine and cooked liver. Muffled voices are coming out from behind the coats that hang haphazardly on hooks by the blue door with a wire window it's centre. My hands are clammy.

Where are the turning point/s? (Narativ) What Happened Last Line. POINTS OF TRACTION (Alice T-C)I look forward to hearing and feeling your stories… 😃 FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE MORE BACKGROUND AND THEORY/PROMPTS see below: Participant 9 went on to say: 'I sat on the train, I looked around and I am not exaggerating, every single person in the carriage had their head down either on a laptop, iPad or phone. Some people had headphones on, some were texting away, some talking and all were in their own little world. I did not have any eye contact from anyone. I felt excluded and alone. That sense of being excluded made me want to reach for my phone and I realised I was only wanting to do so because I felt alone. I wanted to 'connect' with someone, something of interest. I felt a different sense of aloneness sitting there on a train full of people. Attention was elsewhere. It was focused in and out via digital devices. It was not in the immediate space, environment around the people. I do it myself and I know that I am cutting off and going somewhere more comfortable.’ (Participant 9). Many of you also mentioned ‘Trump’: 'Trump is nothing but fake peddling fake news, and yet the residents of the most powerful Country in the world has put their faith in him, (well just under half of them in actual fact)!’ (Participant 13). As I was starting to write this yesterday, 15th May 2017, I also happened to listened upon the attached radio programme. It was called ‘Truth’ Post-Truth and Revolution… StartTheWeek-20170515-PostTruthAndRevolution. mp3To summarise the debate: The speakers talked of 'emotional narratives with more powerful resonances than hard facts'. That our new technologies have a semblance of 'voracity and viral power’, and that depending on the ‘impetus’ or ‘desired result’ can give ‘certain lies… certain traction at certain times.’ So with such fertile ground for 'blaming someone for something’ their is a collapse of 'possibility and potentiality’ bought about through a disbelief in ‘political' agency (truth/facts) and the replacement of ‘personal' agency (celebrity/emotion) a symptom rather than a cause of our times… With emotional resonance overtaking facts, the algorithms that drive social media rocket boost this tendency to feed us with things ‘certain lies’ that we 'feel already’, feeding us dis-information across a network of friends and family who we trust and we forget to be critical of each other… 'We live in an echo chamber – we hear things we want to hear… ’So what we are doing today is perhaps starting to look at how we can create an emotional narrative that brings 'credibility into our ecosystems' – ways to debunk the post-truths by using emotion not as a short cut to sustaining ‘old power systems’ but to 'research new and innovative ways' of challenging our existing hegemony, by bring a variety of voices, giving greater context to feelings and subjective ‘truths’ plural and perhaps seeking to help us think more critically and affect each other more deeply? Trumps ‘heart’ drove the bombing on Syria… not rationality. This is what happens with ‘viral’ emotion in the wrong hands… It is 'Intimately ‘rational’ to distrust our institutions… we need to recognise the power structures behind the viral ’truths’ – there is not one truth. This is Our times… what emotional narratives to we want to resonate that counter ‘certain lies’ with ‘certain truths’ many subjectivities… many voices, many potentialities, many choices… X","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":13,"midCount":4,"highCount":5,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":62,"file":"Transformational Encounters.

Mum is right. If I can’t change my life or my inner world I change my hair. Thankfully for a few years now the balance has tipped from ‘exterior’ to more ‘interior’ world change and my hair is pretty ‘normal’ now. My ‘alarm’ signals are less ‘performed’ and my world is reconfiguring ‘inside out’ rather than ‘outside in’. As we are all sharing in this journey not all ‘touch’ or ‘encounters’, or ‘emotions’ or ‘relationships’ are ‘nice’. Some ‘aha’ moments come from places of deep discord, disharmony and trauma. In 2015 I met a man that changed my life. He woke me up – I left my marriage (a relationship of 18 years) and I flew the nest. With the man I met I felt ‘alive’. Unfortunately, the man was not just my lover, but my liar. However, I still very much value that encounter. Why? Because he enabled me to see my own long lie and I left my marriage to live my truth. In my 2-year encounter with this he also taught me how to get back into my ‘feminine’. I realised I had arguably been living a ‘male’ and ‘maternal’ role in an unhappy marriage. My encounter with the masculine aspects of this man, allowed me to allow my own more feminine aspects to re-emerge. I put hair extensions in my hair, I took my own room and painted it ‘pink’, I dressed more ‘girlie’, I ‘tried on’ the feminine. This outside display allowed my inner world to reform. Reintegrate. Rebalance myself. After only 6 weeks I repainted the room back to white, but my inner feminine had rehomed herself inside me. I was never going to leave her again so I took her with me and we flew together. I invite you today to ‘try on your inner feminine’ what does it feel like? What does it mean? Whether we are residing in male or female bodies we live in Trump’s anti –feminine world, May’s anti feminine aspect. Where does your inner feminine reside. Does she need some love? Love that you can share with our world to change it? For those of you who like a bit of theory here is some, for those of you that don’t – go and sit in your wardrobe amongst the clothes, your clothes, your partner’s clothes, wrap yourself up in your favourite chair, spend all day in bed nesting cuddling your feminine self or a desiring and desirous object. Nurture your inner feminine today in all it multiple aspects. Let her surface, speak, become known. What does she say? ‘It is acknowledged that gender, determined by different genitalia, remains synonymous with female oppression. Much feminist discourse and subsequent queer studies therefore disclaim any return to this biological binary, seeing notions of essential self as mythical and gender/sex positions as instead socially and culturally constructed (Butler, 1990 & 1993) . Conversely, French feminist Cixous, reclaims the biological female body and associated femininities as source of celebration and liberation. Cixous names this process ecriture feminine, a method of female writing from deep within the body. Cixous proposes that all genders and sexualities can appropriate ecriture feminine, within a third space, ‘each one’s location in self… of the presence – variously manifest and insistent according to each person, male or female – of both sexes’ (Cixous 1976 in Marks and De Courtivron 1981b: 254). Indeed, her concept of an awareness of a presence within the self, of both sexes, to the ‘non exclusion either of the difference, or of one sex… [this] ‘self permission’, gives all bodies the potential to feel with multiplicity. (Cixous 1976 in Marks and De Courtivron 1981: 254) The Oedipus myth, normalised as representative of the entire human condition, only refers to father/son, mother/son relationships. It denies any matrilineal relationship of women connected to mothers, sisters and daughters or any suggestion of father/son, father/mother relationships that allow for a female jouissance within and between male bodies also. Roselind Gill (2007) refers to this as adopting a ‘feminine sensibility’. Where might adopting a ‘feminine sensibility’ perhaps help us reform our selves and our world in a different way gently but fiercely challenging, political, cultural and social governance from the inside out?

Reflection-in-action methods include framing and reframing problems, exercising knowledge during practice and reflecting on the results of any practical decisions made. After (Schon, 2003), she adopts a 'bottom up' approach to research where theories are distilled from the data [my prompts your responses my noticings] as opposed to the data being tested against a ‘set or fixed’ hypothesis. Glaser and Strauss, 1967, in Candy and Edmonds, 2011) Participant: Jindal-Snape & Vettraino say, ‘It is important to compare different techniques for different individuals and see what changes need to be made to the technique specific to that individual's needs. ' (2007: 116) Group: Helen Nicolson refers to a type of pedagogy called, ‘Reflect’ a strategy that ‘encourages stories to emerge and discussions to take place, a creative process on which the facilitators build when the group is ready’ (2005: 42). Frances Babbage, a performance ‘theorist' is interested in participant-audience experience and how it works, she says 'The spect-actor, like Sullivan’s reflexive practitioner, shifts continually between action and reflection, immersion and detachment, emotion and analysis, and always in the interest of deepening understanding and promoting dialogue' (Babbage 2016: 50). So today I invite you to invite someone ‘out' and allow them 'in’ through your listening. What is their story? What needs to be heard? How does it feel to hear it? Where do you feel it? Your listening allows their story to be heard and to emerge you complete their story in your listening… wow!

Forty’ It depicts the reflective process I undertook to identify four participants from my own ‘network’ to become pco-participative creators in the project based on a) those who I had only known for under 5 years and b) who would engage in an ‘active’ creative relationship with me in order to get to know each other better.

That this ‘weaker’ tie could offer more potency. Once you have drawn your map, with you in the centre add main ’strong' branches outward to ‘direct’ people/influencers in your life, then from these ‘direct’ people identify and connect other people on who you have met ‘through’ the direct contacts and have remained somehow on your ‘radar', perhaps with a weaker or dotted line. Come up with your own system to code and identify ‘who’ has perhaps now fallen off, (like the mud flying off from a spinning solid like a wheel or a muddy boot), perhaps use a big red X symbol or the such like, also identify who you have recently ‘picked up’ either as ‘a fresh encounter’ or a ‘renewal/alteration’ of a relationship which can now shift gear through you being able to deepen/lessen the balance/intensity/commitment to it because you have perhaps let others ‘go’ or welcomed new ‘in'. Then look at the spaces in-between. You might want to colour them in see how large they are, what shape they are perhaps use different colours for different possibilities/headings/opportunities and create a colour key to identify what these headings are?

Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand. I suppose you are real?  said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.

This is one of my very special places (as it is for many others). There's a Japanese photographer who takes amazing timeless images of sea and sky, but I took this long before I knew about him. This beach always feels prehistoric and timeless to me, and I feel part of that when I'm there. further useful traction points of cross-reference, resonance and resource in relation to your birth skies- It is my symbolic map of navigation- the planetary cycles and anniversaries are waypoints- I have mapped transits and progressions as symbolic meaning in tough timesI keep the fact that I have used a specific esoteric type of astrology since I was around 17 quiet—it is misunderstood and trivialised in popular culture, and has an unfortunate following with smiley practitioners usually dressed in white or purple (should actually be violet, which is more blue than purple [1]) all far too rainbow-dolphin for me. I see it as a vast, complex symbolic system that resonates with my inner life. But I never talk to academic colleagues or most friends about it. I might like to integrate this someday, but without risking intellectual ostracisation or the derision of my rational friends. After many years of private research I made this map to show one set of relationships in Alice Bailey's Esoteric Astrology system, because no-one else has, and because translating her work for a modern audience and stripping away the cultural prejudice of one of the 'founding mothers' of the New Age to reveal the crucial information is a strange and persistent 'calling' that feels like a job I have to do: What seems to align? Sun opposite Saturn (see below)- Mercury and Jupiter conjunction: an expansive and inquiring mind- Mars rising, retrograde soon after birth until almost end of life: frustrating lack of energy- Mars sesquiquadrate Pluto, almost unbearable inner conflict, maturing into resilienceWhat seems untrue? Astrological stereotypes- the unintelligent concept of 'fate'- the idea that planets actually affect us personally- the niggling suspicion that it's all illusion, in the face of symbolic cultural impactWhat insights/resistances offer traction? Saturn opposite sun, learning patience and long-term persistence, continuity. Melancholy progress through pain and challenge but also building stability over time. ‘aha’ moments in image, word, thought, sense, action, colour, sound? not any more, but there may be some in futureWhat intimacy, ‘in-to-me-i-see’ do you see when your 'sky and earth’, or your 'you and I' collide? not sure what this means, but: sky, infinite time, ideals, self regeneration- physical/resource restrictions and distractions versus peace, time to explore- learning all the time from everything- understanding others through experiences that cause me to (think I) feel as they haveBut sky is also nature/earth, being part of and in which is my regeneration.

I wondered why Senegal came to mind and I liked the sound of the line but had no idea what I meant.

I recall sitting at the top of the stairs and crying for so long. Eventually my mother took pity and came up. I can't recall what triggered this event, but there were a few. So I did not want to grow up. I hated the adult world. I think I still do. We are meant to be responsible and coherent, and I do my best but then need to avoid being in it when I am unable to meet those demands. Like now. Like the past two days. Obsessive-compulsiveOCD means focussing on a thing in the world. A ritual, a collection, a habitual series of thoughts. When people are too overwhelming and unpredictable in childhood, a thing or things can be easier. I felt sorry for things, a cereal packet that became empty. Or a broken thing. Maybe I was that broken thing. I just had to re-title all my notes to order them so I can find them. Good OCD. Information sorting/filtering/organising/clarifying is what I spend a lot of time doing. It's good for preparing learning materials but takes a lot of time and falls apart if I don't allow enough space for that time. I only just noticed I can't move a note I made in my own notebook to another notebook, so these are late developers. They're lagging. Time and overwhelm How long can I not wash my hair?

Make something look ordered and we feel that is has actually become ordered. Instead, it's interestingly chaotic (in the mathematical sense) and indefinite (in the philosophical sense). So I have a love/hate thing with numbered lists. I like that someone identified some things that they think are crucial, I don't like that others also have their lists and it's rare to see agreement on which list of things is universal. There can't be a universal one! I dislike even more the tendency for self-promoters to publicise their lists and write books and give talks about their lists. But any map is better than no map as a starting-point. So I love lists too. All this writing might seem distanced, but that's just how it seems. It's actually very personal. Autocorrect told me that it was Cruelly personal. I can't guarantee this volume or depth of output every day. This morning I woke up writing in my head and then writing it into SimpleNote (my text-only bare-bones repository of choice) so this flowed on from that. It also made me strip out everything from Evernote (wants money if you use it on more than two devices). Not a problem, in fact it's helped that long-overdue process, so Evernote is now for one purpose! 1. Attention Yes, when we are with someone who means something to us, or with anyone. Even 30 seconds of undivided conscious attention means so much more than just being there. As long as it's not used as a form of pressure. I've noticed in meetings people are often just waiting for a gap to say what they want. Some people never get that opportunity, or hold back before more assertive voices. Some don't wait for gaps at all and never get heard. Which is why we have the notion of the role of leader, and also why that role often attracts people not used to listening. Introverts and people with quiet voices or thoughts that ponder and wonder and consider before vocalising can be disadvantaged. For me, there's a LOT of social noise with little content, which drowns out any shared solitude and covers up deeper feelings. I still cannot handle crowds well, but I can now meet people's gaze. I had to reach the age of 24 before a friend pointed it out that I didn't. 2. AcceptanceCarl Rogers coined the phrase unconditional positive regard. It works well, unless someone is trying to coerce you from fear. He also had a brilliantly-formulated list of psychological necessities, based on years of research. On Becoming a Person became my guidebook for many years. I forgot all the items on the list, but not until I'd absorbed their meaning. Expecting people or someone to change is a recipe for disappointment. If we are disappointed with someone, we must have had expectations that don't fit their own expectations of what they want to be or are capable of. Sometimes I wake up depressed. Sometimes I get mad at a Thing In The World. Sometimes I am very withdrawn, which can be a rewarding dip into the inner, perhaps just plain weariness, or (I like to think) creative brooding. If I worry that any of the above might have an impact on people I'm close to, I explain and cannot relax until I know they are okay with it. In public or at work I don't really think too much about this, unless I'm having a really extreme day. I'd be crippled by empathy if I did. It very easy to work out who is accepting and who isn't. My partner doesn't take these inner climate changes personally, an ability I am delighted about. And one of the reasons I feel completely happy about the prospect of being married, a thing I didn't expect to do again. Or could have foreseen. For much of my life I tried not to upset people, even when they were being what is labelled unreasonable or angry but is usually just a front for some kind of fear. But that led me away from honesty and towards stressful and life-draining compromise. My days of putting people pleaser above be yourself are hopefully over. I don't think I got it right anyway. In fact I know now I got it quite wrong. I'm not sure anyone can get people pleasing right. 3. AppreciationGifts and caring are not appreciation; they can be nice tokens of a deeper thing, hollow ritual, or something done to make the giver feel worthwhile. Just acknowledging and letting a person be what they are is enough. You know when you're appreciated, and it's easy to make it plain that you appreciate someone, although it has to be in a way they will understand. 4. AffectionEmotional, mental and physical. All different, can all be together or separate. Depends on who. Touch is important, but touch can be mental and emotional we can be 'touched' by someone's feelings or openness, or by the fact that there is a durable shared connection. If I can sit with someone in silence, not needing confirmation of anything, it feels like the deepest intimacy. Touch with harmony is smooth, effortless, just fits, adjustments are intuitive. Touch without harmony feels jagged, awkward. Not being able to be yourself or express everything or having to keep quiet about something for whatever reason creates disharmony. 5. AllowingI don't like this one. If the others are in place, why is it necessary?","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":18,"midCount":2,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":116,"file":"dave responses/08 day: transformational and noticings","title":"08 day: transformational and noticings.","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:00:08","text":"Placeholders: One day my older aunt came to collect me from my parents' downstairs flat to show me a van full of bread that had hit a lamp post just around the corner.

Here's the most recent: For the last few weeks I've been experiencing the deepest and most incapacitating depression (for want of a better word) I've ever felt. It could be that I need (leukaemia) treatment, as the fatigue (and other symptoms) is also very enervating and of concern. Yesterday I felt paralysed, and all I could manage was a bit of essential and long-overdue washing, reading one magazine article during which I fell asleep, and sorting out some receipts, very very slowly. My brain seems not to work well and I can't think straight or focus well at all. The sense of sheer incapacity and demotivation is a bit scary and overwhelming at this level. My fears seem to be exaggerated and I feel imprisoned by extreme inertia and lack of motivation. I'm letting things slide badly, barely managing the essentials. I just read back over the last two instances of this. The only changes seem to be: frustration had been replaced by a defeated sense of apathythe family issues are quieter although they are still unresolvedthere's more neglect but less internal pressure to do thingsI crave/need a lot of time out, but it seems increasingly hard to make it.

DreamLast night I had a remarkable dream. I wandered through this house. The floorboards and rooms were all bare, there was nothing much left and it was obvious that I was moving out, yet in the dream I felt unutterably sad, and had tears in my eyes. I tried to make sense of it, and the first thing that came to mind was that I was dying to my old life (yet again!) and the empty house was me leaving the husk, the chrysalis, if you like, of the old skin I once inhabited. It could no onger contains me or server me in any way, and had to be shed. EmergenceOver the past two months I've attended with my partner no less than 4 artist-related events/private views, in two of which I was a collaborator or had a hand: Georgina Barney's book GB Farming I worked with her on the design and managed the desktop publishing process from start to delivery. Here's my friend François' blog post on the book. Esther Rolinson's exhibition at Watermans A talk between her and Douglas Dodds (V& A Senior Curator, Digital Art). I worked with her on early ideas for her sculpture Splinter and Processing recreations of these. It's all helping me feel part of this again, after so long I feel I'm coming in from the cold. Maybe even my wings are healing a bit. After spending the afternoon and most of the evening at Sean Clark's CyberCulture exhibition, the feeling is that I'm no longer an impostor, I was there then and I'm still here now, and I need to really own this, instead of pretending that I'm a tolerated visitor in a world where people do and have done much more as I see it than I have. I spoke with Sean about being part of the group running the Love Night in Nottingham in the late dance music era, where we had art, drumming, DJs, complementary therapies and tarot readers and a chill-out room all in one building, in separate rooms. I was proud to have been part of it. I'm beginning to see that I do many things, not just one, and that is beginning to be seen. While I was at the LCB someone I knew from my band days 20 years ago approached me, and we chatted. We'll be in touch. He runs some of the stuff at the LCB Depot. It all felt very timely. Yet the precursor was those two weeks of awful mental state. Inner chaos presages or drives the need to change, to make order in the world, creative order of a kind I make with others.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":12,"midCount":7,"highCount":8,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":118,"file":"dave responses/18 Day: Transformation in-out","title":"18 Day: Transformation in-out","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:01:04","text":"I want what I am on the inside to become the outside.

It's a huge virtual world with weather, day/night, food, sleep, resources, skills, conversations with non-player-characters (NPCs that are essentially AI characters programmed to respond to what I do and how I reply), etc. I had a very sobering experience when my actual physical chest started to hurt after getting killed (virtually) in the game (from being too incautious and inexperienced, and panicking). It was so severe I had to lie down, take Nitromin, and sleep for a bit. I've had previous episodes out of the blue, but never synced so closely to a virtual world like that. Bit scary, but maybe this shows the power of our ability to empathise (if that's what it is) within a virtual world. If Mirror neurones are sensitive to characters in virtual worlds, especially in RPGs (Role-Playing Games) where you are the person in the virtual world, then this would tap into other research where simply visualising activities activates parts of the brain and even the body involved in actually doing those same activities. It could also be that I'd played too long, was getting uncomfortable sitting upright and also coming to the end of a long period of stress and ignoring the warning twinges.

My Nana calls the rook she rescued, which flies down from somewhere and lands on her shoulder whenever she stands in the garden and calls Rookie! . I think Sarah-Jane likes me, and I like her too. I am drawn in to the promise of a connection. I am about 5. I reach down to a cat, I think it's Sarah-Jane's parents'. It claws my arm and I am alarmed and shocked. It's the first time I've encountered an animal that harms me. Very soon after this I am in love with Josephine at junior school. My feelings are so intense that hymn 144 acquires a special significance because her surname is Gross. I write 144 in the soap while I'm in the bath. It feels so intense. I choose her in dancing class at school, feeling happy but a bit clueless what do I do now the girl I love is holding my hand? I am 7 years old. Later, when I am 13 she sits behind me in class and I cannot turn round, it is so intense. Unfed and unrealised, the feeling fades within a year or so. I begin to hate my inaction, and feel despair at the fear and hesitation in me, and start to withdraw from life in general. This withdrawal lasts a long time. Back at my parents' home, my neighbour (the girl next door) and I play doctors and nurses. I am not in love with her. In a tent in my parents' garden she says I'll show you mine if you show me yours so we do. I now know that her clitoris was quite pronounced as she could lift it up like a small penis. I just accept everything as it is, all new to me. A bit later we try a kiss, but I don't quite know how. I think our tongues touch a bit. I am 13. Later, we're lying together under my bed (I don't know why, it just feels cosy so that's what we do). She says she has kissamitis or something. I don't quite get it so miss the cue. Over the previous 5 or 6 years she and another schoolfriend used to argue over who would walk me home, but I still didn't get it. I need to catch up with how fast the girls are growing up, and that takes a few years longer. In meantime I fall for Lorraine who (I find out later from my next friendship group) would get stoned and hang out with local musicians, older than her. I just find her irresistibly melancholy and get drawn in. After hanging around during her class in the art room (where I am allowed to go any time I like after refusing to do games on Wednesday afternoons) I ask her out but it is hopeless we haven't even talked before now and she politely declines, saying she can't and smiles faintly, sympathetically. I think it's because she has a thing with one of the older musicians. So there is no we. There was no we for much of that time I spent long periods alone. I failed to make contact, except for a best friend I choose after turning my back on my large friendship group. They had cheated me out of money during the poker we played after school, after I won everything. I had no idea until they told me. They're the alpha group, but they have begun to grow up too fast for me. There's a discussion about whether one of them is going to get a birthday fuck when his girlfriend turns 16. I hate that kind of talk and attitude. I don't want to grow up like that. Next day I go in determinedly alone, knowing I am alone by choice and by the acton of my own will. On that day I reject my former life and friends. After an hour or so I choose the only other person sitting alone and make him my friend. He's an introvert, and we take his sheltie dog for walks. We share our separateness from the big friendship groups. About a year later I join the other big friendship group. They play bridge, not poker, and some of them write poetry. I begin to write poetry too and form a new best friendship. His girlfriend makes it plain that she wants to be with me. I asked him if he's okay with that and he says yes, he likes her best friend (it doesn't last), so we end up as a close foursome of two rearranged couples. A new phase begins. I am 18 and still a bit removed from everything. But I have sex for the first time. I start my first relationship, that lasts for over 3 years. I start to be able to become part of a we.

We used to go out cycling with another friend. I am about 11. A car hit him (I wasn't there). Me and my friend cycle to his house and sit on our bikes. We say to each other Alan's not there any more. We feel very matter-of-fact. We carry on. Without Alan. Roads are lethal. Cars are worse than guns. What a stupid idea: to put people in control of vehicles, and make places where other people walk and cycle right next to fast, hard objects controlled by… PEOPLE. Stupid. Yet, everyone accepts it as normal and there's no initiative to change this madness. We are STUPID STUPID STUUUPID! Later, Beatrice dies in a boating accident. Before she died, we would meet at her house and hang out, a close group. Now, every time I walk past it I feel the hollow, just enough to wonder what actually happened?  or how did she die?  and why did it happen, surely someone could have prevented it?  We carry on. Without Beatrice, or a place to meet up. My father is showing me my Grandad's body, telling me, safely and with confidence Look, grandad's not there any more. I can see that he isn't. This is just a body with no relation to the grandad I knew. The moment is changing me, and the way I see death. My friend PM dies of complications after breast cancer. My first soul-mate. I feel sad we did not actually meet up nearer the day of her death, although settled that she's okay with it and didn't want me to see her like this. I wept when I got the news. A first for a personal bereavement. My cat is in my arms as the vet injects him (terminal liver failure). I look into his eyes, the ones that went gooey with huge pupils as he looked up nestled in my armpit under the covers in bed when I lived alone. My ex asked me to look after him because she kept moving house and he hated it and ran away. He was only just out of kittenhood at the time, so he grew up with me. When I get home I cry and my partner at the time understands and I appreciate that. I am about 5 or 6 (I think) and crying uncontrollably after the Disney film Old Yeller, so much so that my parents don't know what to do with me (It's okay, it's only a film). I let it all out and don't hold back. All that crying I had no excuse for before, and the film has opened the floodgates and now I'm free to cry as much as I want to and I do. To me, animals feel equal, emotionally, to humans. Perhaps even more so when I see they can't understand or tell us how they feel. My doctor tells me he wept more over his cat than his father. I am identifying my father's body, on the floor next to his bed, covered for modesty in a blanket by the officials (I think they might be police but not sure). I know I have to cry. I wait and it comes. Not so intense, just some regret and sadness that today was going to be the first time I visited him for some time. It felt like 'appropriate' grief for an 'appropriate' amount of time. After awhile I go back downstairs and tell them what they want to know. Hearing F's young children wailing with uncontrollable grief and sobbing ‘mum!’ at her funeral as the coffin goes through the curtains into the furnace. The memory even just typing and re-reading this brings tears to my eyes now. F was another soul-mate friend and we went for walks. She was a 'wise woman' and qualified medical herbalist and we discussed alien abduction and invisible beings. She was only in her 30s and it wasn't even fucking cancer, just a stupid untreatable growth that crowded out her insides. So many people I knew died in the space of 4-5 years, including some I haven't mentioned. The feelings of a hollow gut. Of being 'gutted' but not in the stupid superficial way people use the phrase now. Really gutted, because that's how it feels, that someone has taken out part of your insides and there's a hollow. And the lump in my throat, the constriction of swallowing the grief because if I don't it might not stop.","mood":"lowlowlowmidhighhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":10,"midCount":4,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"high"},{"id":125,"file":"dave responses/13 Day: traction-ish","title":"13 Day: traction-ish","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:00:36","text":"Placeholder brief: main moments of ‘Traction’ in your life, real ’Turning Points’, the threshold between before/after.

People might use it as such if they struggle with face-to-face communication or social situations. I don't, but sometimes choose to express myself in written, not spoken words, as the latter can get mangled in the process of speaking and listening. A tool of distance: I see mothers pushing a pram, staring into texts and ignoring their child, even when the child is looking up, wanting a cue, some eye contact. I want to intervene, to tell the child this is not acceptable. I wonder what I would be like now if my mother had been like that. It can feel 'safer' to share digitally, but also exaggerate confirmation bias in a social media bubble where we select our 'friends' to echo our own tastes/tolerances. A tool of tyrannical misunderstanding: A tool of exaggeration or enhancementThe Theosophists' idea of the astral plane is that it is the psychic location we visit in dreams, out-of-body experiences (which I have experienced many times and written about) and after death. Crucially for this comparison, it is held to be a place were individuals are drawn together though similarity, unlike the material world where any individual can meet any other, and in which we consequently encounter dissimilarities. According to the historic occult literature that underlies the New Age movement, on the Astral plane we can encounter only similarity. Social media can become like the Astral plane if we select what we already 'like' and more significantly if the code that serves advertising (on Facebook etc. but also on the web at large) gathers our visits and choices and assembles them into 'our preferences', but only as it sees them (see image what Twitter thinks I like). I see the following as inferentially related, and have always wanted to write about it. The emoji characters in the astral planes of Unicode character encoding give us the Snowman and now-infamous Pile-of-poo (☃ 💩), as well as a load of other 'emoticons' that pepper social media posts and messages. Unicode handles the characters of most languages in an encoding of numbers and letters that range from 0-9, then A-F (U+0000 → U+FFFF). Beyond this 'Basic Multilingual Plane' of 65 thousand symbols are the 'astral planes' where many non-lingual characters live (about 1 million with code points from U+010000 → U+10FFFF). Mere co-incidence that these are now widely-used in the virtual and predominantly 'friends-only' astral-like worlds of social media, or the secret joke of programmers raised on the sci-fi spirituality and Alan Moore occult comic-book world of the early web? Experiences DF's emails (no outcome, identity protected) Many years ago now. A long friendly interchange sharing humour and interests.

She is now married with a daughter and her husband and her are amazing at renovating properties. Although we are still friends on social media with the same level of understanding, there's also acceptance of separate real lives. Fania's emails (massive outcome) A long build-up of communication that soon began to feel very intimate psychologically, with an ease of sharing our inner selves. A feeling that we were 'courting' instead of the common genitals-first approach, helped by physical distance mediated by technology. A sense of increasing connection through email, and an ability to share without to much vulnerability, yet also a willingness to feel vulnerable and share anyway. Eventual disclosure of real feelings by email, paralleled by long discussions and real-world connection. Tentative and cautious yet with a high degree of certainty. Key emails: I like rain and stars, Mono no aware (sharing a Japanese philosophical phrase we both felt at home with and the title of a short story). 物の哀れ mono no aware a melancholy sensitivity to ephemera, an awareness of the impermanence or transience of things and an accepting wistfulness at their passing, as well as a longer deeper gentle sadness that this state is the reality of life itself.

I still really dislike the term. I understand I have the privilege (as it has been described, although it is also a burden) of my gender. But I do not identify with it entirely, and resisted adopting 'manhood' for as long as possible. I even toyed with the idea of cross-dressing in a Grayson Perry-kind of way, or 'trying to be a girl', but the urge never really took hold. I parted my hair the wrong way in a mirror with my friend at around the age of 12 so I could 'look like a girl' and (under the influence of oxygen, which we used to make in his parents' garage and inhale) I put on his mother's fur coat. I found out much later that my father was disturbed by homo-erotic dreams. I didn't know this, my daughter read his diary after his death and told me. He bought me a football at around age 6 so I wouldn't 'grow up to be a pouf' but I hated sport. He accepted me as 'artistic/creative' in the end, so he must have been relieved. I have a picture of both parents cross-dressed for a fancy-dress thing. My father had a crisis at some point, and my mother told me he probably fell in love with a man. She also fell in love periodically, later on quite openly. She told me that my brother might not be my brother but apparently he is. Two of my partners were bisexual women, the first got me to wear makeup sometimes when I went out. I like being in an 'equal' role physically as well as psychologically, if that's at all possible with actual gender differences and all that cultural baggage and presumption. And the other person needs to feel similar. My auntiesI was raised by women: my grandmother (a union leader in the boot and shoe industry in Leicester) until I was 3, and then two 'aunts', both teachers, one the leader of the women's section of the Leicester Labour Party (when they had a womens' section). They taught me a lot, and I used to leave my parents in their flat on the ground floor and go upstairs to 'live' with my 'aunties' who shared a large flat. I know now I imprinted massively on one of them, who had long black hair and an 'academic' appearance. She was the younger of the two. The older had false teeth that clacked when she talked. She knew I liked to see vehicle collisions; it was a trait that disturbed my father so much he showed me a book with graphic images, which I found in his stuff when he died and still have. I once flattened a toy car of his—he called me a destructive little (something I can't recall) and his outburst shocked me, as I was only about 4. Later, I used to ram my pedal car against walls and lamp-posts, and it kind of excited me (yes, I've seen 'Crash' and it wasn't like that although I get it). One day my older aunt came to collect me from my parents' downstairs flat to show me a van full of bread that had hit a lamp post just around the corner. There was squashed bread on the road, and I was fascinated by the 'disruption' (fashionable word) from the normal. I was obsessed with cars and could name them just by listening to the tone of the exhaust. The failure of asexuality After my first relationship (just over 3 years from age 18) I tried to be asexual by renouncing everything and living in the ashram of a Hindu cult (in the UK—this began, unsurprisingly, in Leicester). This was an uphill struggle from the start, especially being at art college, surrounded by the sexual charge of my peers. But I stuck it out as best I could for a year until I met my first wife. Who I also resisted, until I stopped resisting. At one point I actually put her on the guru's altar in the ashram, to 'give her back'. What a naive fool I was, unprepared for my own sexuality. Anger and 'man-ger' I was afraid of my parents' anger and became afraid of my own, which I suppressed for years, bottled up ever since being the target of it, even indirectly. I felt massive injustice at witnessing my parents' anger. Massive hurt and injustice. I wanted to burn down the house and run away. I became emotionally attracted to a certain amount of anger—until I married someone who I saw (IIRC) throw a teapot at someone in the ashram, where we supposed to be all love and peace. Later, my own 'anger management' had two rules: 1. never hit or harm anyone; 2. never break anything valuable. I did harm myself sometimes. Nowadays if I get mad (dropping something on the floor by accident, burning the dinner) I get mad and swear but I also laugh and fool about at the same time. But it takes a partner who 'gets it' to understand that! Owning manhood Although I really dislike 'bloke/lad culture', I don't mind being 'masculine' (whatever that means) when necessary. I think the first time I noticed this was with a colleague (sales staff). We used to go to see clients (I worked in the 'art' department drawing graphics) and she was trying to park. I had no qualms about her driving, but on this occasion the parking was going particularly badly for some reason. We got on really well, so I knew I could be direct with her. After a few minutes I said, with a smile ‘get out!’ so I could swap to the driver's seat. She laughed and made it clear that she was happy for me—on this occasion—to ‘take control’, and it felt like a very new experience for me. She let me know afterwards that she took it favourably, and told the others at the office. It was a bit weird because most of the time I think the female staff saw me (in the ‘art department’) as quite distinct from the ‘businessmen’ they dealt with most of the time, so treated me like one of them. Later, I was surprised and—I admit—flattered to discover that some of the staff found me attractive, which took a lot of getting used to. I still had an ‘asexual’ kind of inner self and it took many more years for me to ‘own’ my sexuality. Fucking hell that obviously hit a vein.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":14,"midCount":5,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":130,"file":"dave responses/17 day: soup","title":"17 day: soup","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:01:01","text":"A: research/prepare how you might go about 'creating a beautiful soup or (other such dish/meal of your choosing) to eat with a loved one/s' sometime over the next remaining 7 days or so.

Daughter: New Ways I’m trying to get out Find a subtle way out Not just cross myself out Not just disappear I feel as if I've had another life, in fact 3-4 other lives, during my one lifetime and somehow, moved on from them as I've changed, or gradually forgot myself while adapting. I now miss myself from my own relatively mid-recent past. I lost track and need to spend a lot of time bringing those things back into my current life, I withdraw into sorting through stuff. What do I bring into now, what gets dumped, what will become part of a permanent me? Changes in software over time and in my computers mirror this. I always thought of my laptop as temporary but it's been my main computer for years. My old iMac desktop can't run the latest OS, yet has software (pre-subscription Photoshop, Illustrator, even, at one point but no longer, HyperCard) I can no longer run on my laptop. So my digitised life is split in two, one anchored by the inertia of neglect and abandonment (mine and by companies), and the other by the urge to build anew. So I have short bursts when I sort files, bring them across, putting them or re-making in more future-proof formats that don't depend on what a company decides to do. Like plain text, web formats (independent of online services) image formats that don't die, etc., but more complex things are harder maybe svg and other formats that will always be computer-readable in the future. In doing this, I re-find things about myself I had forgotten or even lost, valuable things I've put time and myself into, then just moved on. I want some of it back, because I now recognise them as part of my own self, a self I've abandoned. This all reads very much like the 'me' generation, obsessed with identity and self-expression, careless about community or ultimately about the lives of others. I'm not sure where I stand, but it's not there. From a post by one of my daughters I recently read about the Xennial micro-generation (born 77-83) between the Millennials and Gen-X. I too feel 'between' categories, between the end of the hippies and the start of the grunge era.

Then I didn't want to include any clues, so I simply drew them out: The shifting of friends as I and they mutate, grow and change- My need for a map or categorical list of my contacts, to help me understand myself. networking with our own many selves the above as a mirror for social needs we are actually different selves across time, and reaching our goals requires getting them to cooperate—Tiago Forte (yet another confident self-promoter on Medium), 24 May 2017, Productivity for Precious Snowflakes: a Mood-First Approach to Knowledge Work. The lists below are apart from my intimate relationship and expanded family, which have become central, as represented in the picture. The ones who represent the Strength of Weak Ties are marked (SWT), except they weren't weak ties, just gateways to other networks. Oldest friends: Pete, school best friend now in touch again Sally, known for years opened other networks (SWT)- Jo, knew from work, writer, long periods of silence- Valerie, from Art CollegeSoul-sharing friends (dead): Mary- Paula- FranCurrent friends: Graeme- Alex- Styx (from music) Friends from music: Chris Conway (SWT)- Ben Daglish- Kate Rounding- Andy Martin, originally a work colleague (SWT) Outliers who now know no-one else: Jo (in oldest friends) - Jayne (ex-partners as friends) Former important friends: Jos (Joscelyne), first person I met in Melton (SWT) - Fiona, opened up vast Nottingham-based network (SWT) - Kindy, from above- Fred, from above, married Kindy- Jackie, first long-term partner after marriage, got me enjoying life, Relationships:First real kiss at 17, from my schoolfriend's elder sister (25) who was engaged. After that we hung out with my friends and messed with each other a lot, but she kept the final boundary in place. Every single relationship changed me, some of them a lot. Every one was valuable, although a few were very challenging and mostly from fear and some cowardice in facing the likely reaction I didn't communicate well enough or soon enough how I was really feeling. Trying to make sense of too much, I have listed my relationships in the past, and have a folder named (to my embarrassment) ex-files to keep what I value and personal mementoes, as well as to jog me into awareness about how I treat others or how I let them treat me. Until about 16 years ago, when I think began to know myself a bit better, or when I wanted stability above all, or when I had been hurt/disappointed or had hurt/disappointed another one too many times, probably from a difficult and then-unresolved combination of: over-identifying (co-dependency) - over-adapting though wanting to be loved- losing myself meeting the needs of another too passively- too much quiet eagerness to not rock the boat/rattle the cage- (early on) letting my obsessions become controlling- being attracted to difficultyI am still afraid or nowadays at least aware of my own ability to hurt and to be hurt, but that doesn't prevent me from loving and being loved. Being terrified of facing that which I know will cause pain in another (and secondarily hurt to myself) even to the point of self-denial but causing pain by failing to face it adequately or in a timely way is a trait I never want to repeat. My father's persistent admonition to not upset anyone had gone really awry. I might as well have been brought up with Japanese manners: yes: はい = I will consider your request- yes: I would love to but…  in other words = no いいえ. I felt at home yet at sea during the 10 days I spent in Japan, and missed it so much when I got back to the UK. I made proper miso soup almost every day for more than a year. I always enjoy wandering alone in another country although I have twice been one of the first arrivals at a dead person in the street (Bordeaux, with a previous partner and Lisbon) an experience that haunts me even now but Japan was in a class of its own regarding the degree of harmonious experience. OFC that's what some would think you'd expect, in a culturally-stereotypical way, but then neither did I really get to know anyone, although I did talk with the crown prince for 20 minutes about British canals. Both me and my partner visited Japan at a time of disaster: I left days before the Kobe earthquake, she was there when the tsunami wrecked Fukushima. Friends when bringing up children some last, some don'tSeeing middle-class mothers with their screaming, unreasonable toddlers (OFC they are, they don't know restraint at that age, that's our job!) in Clarendon Park, attempting to drink coffee and have a conversation, trying to be themselves again, clawing back some adult time away from the constant need to be on call to their children, the shock awakening that it's not easy and they can't just carry on as before. The lies of the marketing and social pressure around 'babies'. Maintaining a 'civilised' middle-class demeanour in the face of their children's out-of-control behaviour. Too cultured to shout GERREA NAAAH!!!  as their offspring race around the place, they simply apologise to the café owner and people nearby, who smile and say it's okay and coo and again smile sympathetically. If it gets too bad, they just take the child home, while it is crying. I recall a similar network of shared child-rearing, keeping parents sane and in touch when they became overwhelmed and tired. And drinking wine at dinner parties because that was the fastest way to switch off and remain sociable. For me: meditation groups with our eldest daughter asleep in a carrycot. Staring into her wondering and curious gaze at birth, compared with the later tensions and connections/disconnections of relating as an adult. The delight of communication when children start to learn about the world, and taking them on adventures in nature. The differing qulaity of two children, highlighted in understanding that they need to learn how to read in very different ways. The alarm at the way some other parents talk to their children, or fail to relate to them. As an extension of Alice Miller's (<- that's two links) insightful observation about the enlightened witness (at least one person, not necessarily [a] parent, who loved them or cared about them but was 'unable to protect them' from… abusive or neglectful parent or parents), perhaps even a knowing smile from an adult even a passing stranger to a child suffering at the hands of an adult, can provide an opportunity to realise they do not have to accept this as 'normal' or 'acceptable'; even hopefully provide a tiny foothold so they begin to climb out of the trap they're in. If someone is shouting at their child unreasonably, smile knowingly, empathically, at the child (without the parent seeing, unless you want to get shouted at too). I've done it. It's very small, but it just might make a difference. The influence of network research on meThe importance of interarchies: the web isn't a hierarchy, it's an interarchy (<- from the text in that software for connecting to servers, when it first came out) Pioneering research that changed my world-view: Duncan Watts, Six degrees of separation Mark Granovetter, The strength of Weak Ties (mind-opening) Robert Axelrod, The evolution of co-operation. The slides and references in my art-tech presentations about modelling art co-operation that start here about this.

Earthly anchors: David Charles William Everitt Leicester 21: 4524 March 1952 Vera May Hill (married: Everitt) William Arthur Everitt My horoscope: a symbolic anchor on the planet, frozen at birth. Prelude (that's how I see it) Heathcliffe. But I like Running up that hill. You must like Kate Bush… one of the small numbers of real individuals in music. I get the story, a bit, though I don't really have a good memory for novels. Task one Then listen to this, whilst reading this- I can't listen to music with words and read, so I did one after the other. Got to dance: feels like a threat to an introvert. Obviously Red Shoes take away control. I was in my late 30s before I could dance really. It was a lot easier at dance parties at the Marcus Garvey in Nottingham or at an illegal rave near the A1 because with 90s dance music no-one judged you at all and everyone was welcome. It was wonderful. J was my partner for over 3 years and helped me express myself outwardly and not be afraid in clubs. I danced like a mad person to my friend's band when we went to see them. I can't do this now, I'm too ill. She-Bear: in one of the most remarkable dreams I ever had I was in a polar bear den with the polar bear mother. We emerged after hibernation and I felt completely safe. I really felt I was there in the dream, it was hyperreal and the feeling of closeness and total empathy persists. Your mapping from the page to the space in the PDF looks like the Great Bear constellation, which has huge significance for my private esoteric self. I would have found this performance intimidating because I find confrontation difficult. I feel all the tension between the different characters and almost feel it's personal, either aimed at me or I am living out my own inner conflicts. But that's how drama works. Task two. 1listen to this with your eyes closed, hands over heart and breathe. When the song ends, go out and walk somewhere without plans… for at least 5mins ‘away' and 5mins back to ‘home’. Extend the journey if you like but notice where you are when you reach your ‘turning point’. This track starts with what sounds like Alice Bailey's voice (her brief biography is in this video) reading the Gayatri mantram, which threw me into a completely other place, based on my past and confidential present. Confidential because most of my colleagues at uni have a rational world-view that edits out anything a bit woo-ey and the New Age has become so debased it's a joke, and because of that I too edit it out. But the founders are different, and I feel at home with them. Alice Bailey was a former Christian evangelist who turned Theosophist and became a writer of esoteric books intuitively 'dictated' by a mysterious individual known as 'The Tibetan' (see the biog video above). The Lucis Trust has a page on the Gayatri. I gave a talk on her life some years ago to the Leicester Theosophical Society I know her work well and have lived with it since I was around age 17. I have more on this but rarely share it outside that group, with which I now have little contact. It all reminds me of the women I grew up around, some of who had lived through that period, most notably Mary Swainson (Leicester University page on her funeral), who became a close and very dear friend until she died at the age of 100 over a decade ago (my counsellor knew her well too). This is all deeply crucial and formative for me, and I spent many years in the company of such people, and in conversation with Mary, including letters in which we shared our adolescent poetry! She was a kind of guardian for troubled (and sometimes emerging young) people, and a guide to them, but in our contact we rapidly outgrew that role when I was in my 20s and formed a deep bond. Task two. 2When walking listen ‘inside' your body and recall your own birth-day (or one of them) perhaps the threshold of becoming an ‘adult’… or 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 or 70I forgot to do this because I can't recall a single birthday apart from the last, where I'd already agreed a 'present amnesty'. I find birthdays a bit stressful unless I can do what I want, which is what I usually do, and I don't like the pressure of thinking about other people's birthdays. If I care for them I hope it is evident on other days, and I may or may not send a card/present. Sounds harsh but it's how I feel, and I don't mind being treated the same way. The dominance of the decimal number system means stupid cards with supposed 'landmarks' just because they end in a '0' or a '5'. I don't like it at all. These invented thresholds when we are supposed to change? How about prime number birthdays? or ones divisible by 3 or 9? And why the Sun? Why not a Jupiter or Saturn return birthday (approximately every 12 or 28 years) or even Mars (every 2 years) celebrating what those planets symbolise in mythology? Dane Rudhyar (I have his biography, written by a DMU colleague) outlines the 84-year cycle of the planet Uranus, as suggesting major points in a life. The Sun return is the mainstream birthday, the one everyone recognises. I ranted. What happened is below, but here, about a birthday, I can only throw in what I recall… how did you feel? free from obligation or pressure- how do you feel now as you walk in your body now, in the moment in this time? in touch with something profound and fundamental to me- what moves within and outside of you? Air, spirit (for want of a better word, really) and the birds singing at the midpoint- How does it move? It is still and constant- Where? everywhere I am, and probably also where I am not- How do you know? I just doTask two. 3Have a conversation between you ‘now’ and your younger self ‘then’ what do you say? I am now what you were then, you will forget, snd then remember and forget again and remember and the rememberings may last longer when you finally learn to hold firm and be honest with yourself at whatever apparent and real cost under pressures that are not yours. At some point you will remember forever and no longer drift away from yourself. Is that what we are all moving towards? Or just me and other people I know? Task two. 4When you get back home please share your ‘walk' story Before, After, Beyond. <rant>Evernote? Where is the fucking picture I put in from my phone?? WHERE??? I can see it in the preview look!! Over there!! <- Sort your software out NOW!! I get really mad when software has bugs. We deserve better. But Alice, none of this is your fault, just saying : -) </rant> Here is what came: I don't look for anything, it comes to me - the smell of animal scent - small trees trying to root yet reach for light, because I let them, but they cannot stay, except for F's oak tree. I want to accelerate time so the is the only tree, but the neighbours probably won't want it. People in the midlands hate trees. I have such a gardens front and back, but 7 trees of various kinds, including a cherry with beautiful striped bark, nestling next to a lilac where I threw a cherry stone not so long ago. the garden is a small wild place, with a little tailoring- I want animals and plants to be at home here- every neighbour within sight has a different idea of what a garden is but most like to prune nature a lot, mow it all the time, make I'm doing SOMETHING noises with machines in it or put decking or paving over it- I hate barbecues. Hate them. But I will eat from them if a guest, politely, so as not to offend. I belong to many but choose to be with one- there was no turning-point, other than the in/out-pause-out/in like breath- the dusk is a turning-point between day/night, the time for quiet contact of some kind. Blackbird song echoes in the dusk air, transports me- midpoints are portals- my body is not it, my sense of a self dissolved into others and the natural world is where I am anchored, where I regenerate- the confidence of knowing that level of inner peace that depends on no-one and nothing- 'trying' to be 'mindful' is a bit funny to me. Why try? If we're being ourselves honestly and completely does it come naturally, without thinking about it? My spiritual mothers? Having watched the Alice Bailey biography video and the start of another but far less compelling so-called 'New Age'-ish video (about 'free energy' and the 'torus as a universal form' why do people with 'the answer' put themselves centre stage, however benignly?) I recall the women at the heart of the early New Age, people with a big influence: Edna Harrison (or is it her friend Ruth that is 'Harrison', and Edna had another surname?): early mentor, free educator, meta-mother, guide to good creativity- Mary Swainson: guide, friend, loved one, deeply respected one. Alice Bailey: influencer, lifelong obsession, nothing like me so what do I find there?","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":23,"midCount":5,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":134,"file":"dave noticings/Day 21: Noticings.

Passover This is a crisis I knew had to come, Destroying the balance I'd kept. Doubting, unsettling and turning around, Wondering what will come next. Is this the role that you wanted to live?

Disturbing and purging my mind, Back out of my duties, when all's said and done, I know that I'll lose every time.

The 'courting' instead of genitals-first, helped by physical distance mediated by technology – this is really interesting – like to explore this ‘slowness’ in the use of technology… to slow down engagement rather than ‘fast track’ I have many emails shared during that time. I even thought about writing a programme with Fania that analyses them lexically to find the predominant vocabulary we used. But a bare word-count would ignore the weight of certain phrases. We took a long time over our communication in words. Really wanted to get to know the other person anyway, no matter what happened. Safer to share digitally – what do you mean by this? Does it need to become more ‘safe’? Yes, digital sharing is like a dry run. Touching from a distance. An ability to see how another responds without being trapped in a situation from which it's hard to escape in a physical encounter without awkwardness or hurt. Not that this was the intention. Mediated sharing feels intimate psychologically; face-to-face sharing can fail because of the visual/auditory superficials of a person/situation. The projection and the misunderstood cues. The nerves. The food particles in the teeth. The OMIGOD I can't believe I told you that now I think you hate me! The awkward silences before you know whether the other person appreciates quiet. The madness of trying to actually EAT AND TALK AND CHEW UP FOOD AND SWALLOW IT on an early date! All that. Avoided in mediated, written communication. Astral plane.

Lovely to be reminded. I have to admit we overcame a lot of boundaries: social, internal, logical and personal, to be together. But I have never been as close to anyone before this. Perhaps I wasn't ready. Fucking hell I took long enough to learn what I had to/wanted to learn to get where I am now. In counselling for years, years. Still am. My first counsellor killed himself, but I knew it wasn't anything to do with me. Colliding: The squashed toy cars look like that one of my dad's I flattened (green and black, pictures of passengers printed on the tin windows I think I held it's lack of realism against the poor thing). Later I used to visit railway lines with a friend and place things (mostly coins) on the track for the trains to flatten, then take them home. Another friend and I took it in turns to bring a toy when we met to smash up or burn. Were we both secretly angry and as children, unable to express the forbidden? Or just 'being boys'? Maybe for me I couldn't be too angry as a child because adults retained the power to keep my expression within tolerable boundaries. Now I am thinking of course of my own children and what I passed on (fail) or managed to not pass on (success). If it's that binary, which OFC it never is. Dave: I held back until I was well into middle age before I could describe myself as a 'man'. I even toyed with the idea of cross-dressing in a Grayson Perry-kind of way, or 'trying to be a girl', but the urge never really took hold. I parted my hair the wrong way in a mirror with my friend at around the age of 12 so I could 'look like a girl' and (under the influence of oxygen, which we used to make in his parents' garage and inhale) I put on his mother's fur coat. My father had homo-erotic dreams. I have a picture of both parents cross-dressed for a fancy-dress thing. My father had a crisis at some point, and my mother told me he probably fell in love with a man. Two of my partners were bisexual women, the first got me to wear makeup sometimes when I went out. I like being in an 'equal' role physically as well as psychologically. I was raised by women: I used to leave my parents in their flat on the ground floor and go upstairs to 'live' with my 'aunties' who shared a large flat. The older had false teeth that clacked when she talked. Crashes… This needs working with – replay – toy cars collisions – Dad. I want to ‘collide’ on this… One day my older aunt came to collect me from my parents' downstairs flat to show me a van full of bread that had hit a lamp post just around the corner. There was squashed bread on the road, and I was fascinated by the 'disruption' (fashionable word) from the normal. I was obsessed with cars and could name them just by listening to the tone of the exhaust. I’d love to hear this story from the perspective of Day 8… fascinating… What a naive fool I was, unprepared for my own sexuality. Anger – man – ager – anger Later, my own 'anger management' had two rules: 1. never hit or harm anyone; 2. never break anything valuable. I did harm myself sometimes. Nowadays if I get mad (dropping something on the floor by accident, burning the dinner) I get mad and swear but I also laugh and fool about at the same time. But it takes a partner who 'gets it' to understand that! Calm? Both my youngest daughter and my friend and programming co-developer told me that its' a surprise when I get mad (it never lasts longer than about a minute or two, mostly less), because I'm so calm all the rest of the time. It always feels safe to me to let off steam (swearing at the news) but I know other people might not get it and feel disturbed or even take it personally. Or just not want to be around. That's why it's important for me to be with people who understand me on all levels, enough to know, to see past the surface, to see the big picture.

I watched two magpies build a nest in one of the oak trees in the garden. They worked together and they worked tirelessly, but they didn't lay their eggs in there. They built another nest in one of our fir trees on the other side of the garden more secluded. The same couple built 2 nests one with labour left empty and one with love full of life. At this point, I am concerned that our house will be like the nest in the oak tree. But my nest already has 2 beautiful daughters, it just needs a little more love. I wish you love, strength, honesty, courage and friendship XOakThe oak is the mightiest of trees and symbolizes strength and courage. The ancient Romans thought oak trees attracted lightening and thereby connected the oak tree to the sky god, Jupiter and his wife, Juno, the goddess of marriage. Thus, the oak is a symbol of conjugal fidelity and fulfillment. The oak tree was regarded by Socrates as an oracle tree. The Druids likewise ate acorns in preparation for prophesying. In addition, the Druids believed the leaves of the oak tree had the power to heal and renew strength. Photo courtesy of Philip Halling, Wikimedia Commons. Fir Tree One of the nine sacred woods of used for a sabbat fire the Druids held the fir in high esteem. It is a symbol of honesty, truth and forthrightness because of the way it grows on the straight and narrow. The trunk of the fir reminds us of a tall straight pillar of strength, a symbolic tower of truth. Grouped together, they are a symbol of friendship. This symbolism is furthered by the fact that firs are evergreens.

However, I was completely fascinated by my own breast milk waking up covered in it. It made me feel very 'womanly' and richly productive! I like to touch… my husband's heart, but it won't let me in. DEEP PAIN. Knock knock who’s there… I am completely in touch with… exhaustion. I'm ill, I'm fighting, I'm struggling.

My laughter and my power as a mother. It keeps me going. Woaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh. YES. I am here. I have secret soft nestled ‘favourite pages…’ they are deeply mine… The past touches me like… a shove in the back pushing me towards the future towards the hope of tranquillity, contentment, and authenticity. This is the text from the above: The smell of milk, dew-drenched greenery, sour and clear, a memory of wind, of air, of seaweed (as if a body lived without waste): it glides under my skin, not stopping at the mouth or nose but caressing my veins, and stripping the skin from the bones fills me like a balloon full of ozone and I plant my feet firmly on the ground in order to carry him, safe, stable, unuprootable, while he dances in my neck, floats with my hair, looks right and left for a soft shoulder, slips on the breast, swingles, silver vivid blossom of my belly and finally flies up from my navel in his dream, borne by my hands. My son (Kristeva, Stabat Mater 141). Is theory more important than this? The smell of milk (dried, it is soursweet and will draw any baby to you, nuzzling and mewling), which resides alongside the Virgin Mother and the semiotics of milk and tears. The language of fluid. While the rest of this writing, the stories not of mothers and babies, but one mother and one baby, came out smooth and fast, as soon as I see or hear or write that word, theory, I slow. I am concerned with the placement of things. I do not have the sense of being free. But if there’s anything that should come from this vain attempt to answer Cixous, to write your self. Your body must be heard (880), it should be that freedom and theory, boundary-lessness, is where I reside. If anything should come from this, it is the knowing that theory is the most creative pursuit, and that creativity will always speak to theory. There are fewer divisions than any of us realise, and the leakiness of bodies, of this body, will get me there. The smell of this page is of lichor; a clean but heady smell, thick with old cells and a foetus’s breath. The smell of this page is of blood and saliva and milk mixed (the colour like rotten strawberries or the soaked pad at the bottom of your tray of supermarket mince). It is a smell that you will secretly savour, breathe deeply, and then long for lemon zest or the sharpness of coffee beans to send away that angelic fug. That milk and tears have a language of their own is undeniable. Kristeva says they are metaphors of non-language, of a ‘semiotic’ that does not coincide with linguistic communication (Stabat Mater 143) but what I know is that these fluids were the first language for my children. Were they the first language for me? Because it must be true: babies drink language along with the breastmilk: Curling up over their tongues while they take siestas–Mots au lait, verbae cum lacta, palabros con leche (Wasserman quoted in Giles 223). The enduring picture I have of myself as an infant is of a baby who didn’t cry, but my mother will tell you a different story, in the way that all of us do. She will tell you I didn’t smile until I was five months old (Soli and Jem were both beaming at three months). Born six weeks premature, my muscles took longer to find their place, to assemble themselves under my skin. She will tell you I screamed in the night, because all babies do. Is this non-language? Jem was unintelligible much of the time. I felt as if I was holding a puzzle. Three o’clock in the morning, having tried breastfeeds, a bath with Nick Drake’s Pink Moon, bouncing him in a baby sling on the fitball (wedged into a corner so that if I nodded off I would hopefully swoon backwards, and the wall would wake me), walking him around and around while rocking and singing, then breastfeeding again, and still he did not sleep, and still he cried and clawed at my cheeks and shoulders and wrists and writhed; I could not guess at what it was he needed. I had never been less concerned with the self that was me. I was all breasts and milk and a craving for barbecued chicken and watermelon at three in the morning because he was drinking every ounce of energy I had. I was arms and a voice. I was food. And then I learnt other things; about let downs and waking up in pools of the stuff. Wet. Everywhere. Lactating bodies tend towards anarchy (Bartlett 163). Any body will tend towards anarchy – there is so much to keep in – but there are only so many openings a person can keep track of, and breastfeeding meant a kind of levelling up, meant I was as far from clean and proper as I possibly could be (Kristeva, Powers of Horror 72). In the nights I was not alone. Caren could not breastfeed him, but could do everything else, and never said I have to work tomorrow, because she knew I was working too.

We are presenting our research as part of a philosophy and performance conference in Prague next month and as yet have no funding secured, no accommodation booked, no flights arranged! We drank, we talked, we didn’t work – we laughed instead. Our encounters arise out of our shared interest in philosophy and learning about the nature of being in this world.

Weaknesses:… she is rebellious and sometimes tactless when offering opinions. You may be given to spending money impulsively. 402 Conjunction Sun NeptuneThere is an unmistakably dreamy, inspired, and sensitive side to you. A marked appreciation for music and the arts is present. The connection of Neptune with the Sun, which represents the ego and the will, certainly softens some of the hard edges that might be found elsewhere in the chart, adding a sensitive and spiritual dimension to your personality. You are naturally compassionate. It is so completely natural for you to accept that there is more to the world than what is before your eyes, that you tend to presume everyone must be spiritually-inclined. Of course, you come to realize that this is not the case at some early point in your life. Your attraction to spirituality and metaphysical subjects is usually marked. These aspects favor writers, artists, and musicians. You are sensitive to those who are suffering, although you are not usually taken advantage of. You are humanitarian and may have a special connection with animals. If other aspects and positions in the chart support it, you are not one to dominate others or assert yourself to the point of brashness. You have a fertile imagination, are full of inspiration, and very emotional all qualities that you may use on the professional level. You are not fond of superficiality, and are generally the first to spot pretense of any kind. You are passionate and can be intense. You have a hunger to experience more than just an ordinary life, and you can be quite ambitious. Some people with this aspect are perfectionists, demanding much from themselves and reasonable amounts of effort and honesty from others. These people express their affection for the people they care about in little, but practical, ways. They can be a little stiff when it comes to open, gushy displays of affection. Lunar Virgos are often shy with new people. However, when they are comfortable, they are anything but shy. More often than not, others can count on Moon in Virgo people. They are reliable and trustworthy. Above all else, Lunar Virgos are practical. Others turn to them for help and advice. In relationships, Lunar Virgos can be self-effacing and kind. Some are quite shy in love, and easily intimidated on a sexual level. Many are not very comfortable with their sexuality, but they aim to please nonetheless. The sign of Virgo is very body-aware, in general. If this awareness combines with a lack of self-confidence, Lunar Virgos can be too aware of the parts that make up the whole. This can lead to a tendency to be intensely self-critical. Once Lunar Virgos learn to come out of their shell, however, they can be earthy partners with a lot to give Lunar Virgos seem very interested in others' problems, for example, but can be quite cool and even unsympathetic in the long run. Their advice can seem hard to more sensitive folk; yet Lunar Virgos can be surprisingly delicate when faced with others' criticism. Virgo Moon people are generally busy and quietly happy when they have their lives under control. They aim for a simple existence, and are often quite content with very little. Many are early risers, ready to take on the day with enthusiasm. They scurry around, keeping busy and managing their life quietly and expertly. As long as their little world is manageable, Lunar Virgos can be a delight to be around. You are generally amiable and project a soft and yielding manner. You possess natural charm and you are highly imaginative and sympathetic. You can make an excellent mediator and go-between. You are keenly aware of your need for relationships and for intimacy. You have a well-developed respect for qualities typically associated with the feminine. People appreciate you for your tender heart and friendly, diplomatic disposition.

She is a little hard on herself but, above all, on others whose capacity for action is not as greatSensual, the world of touch and smell is most appealing to you. Complex or mysterious partners are not as intriguing to you as simple and genuine ones.

You will meet yourself (the darker side or inner demons) through your relationships, and it will be critical that you recognize it as your own material and not project it onto your partner. Mars in Virgo natives get things done--quite well! They have a knack for handling a wide variety of tasks at once, and a tendency to take on perhaps too much at the same time. Most Mars in Virgo natives are not particularly aggressive by nature. Although they can be a little hard-nosed and critical at times, they rarely resort to pushing others around. Still, an annoyed Mars in Virgo native can be difficult to be around! Arouse their anger and they turn into complaining, over-critical nags. Generally, these natives don't make themselves nuisances, so this stage is unlikely to last for very long. It is a sensitive position, however. It doesn't take much to make these people nervous. Mars in Virgo people are quite protective about their system for getting things done. In a sense, their performance in bed is similar to their work. These people want to be good at what they do. They will generally be open to experimentation, if only to feed their curiosity and to feel savvy. There's often a shy and humble side to Mars in Virgo in any area that involves putting themselves out there and letting go (areas ruled by Mars). But experience and knowledge are important to these natives, and this drive generally wins over their natural reticence.

Rain Mac. Pompoms and finger-knitting were favourites of mine. The owner of the cafe sexually assaulted me and I didn't tell anybody. Like a dog without a bone. You could just listen, but don't make any judgements. Could you give me a hug, please? Of course. They stand and hold each other for a moment. THINK TRACTION: What part of you do these words touch? Where do they land? What blockages are they signalling? What encounters are they enabling? What action might your words galvanise? What dialogue can we have? And now in any way you wish… images, words, film, sounds… re-write your ‘We’ story out from your bodily responses and places trying feelings first and to not lead with your mind… to know is to feel even if to feel is not yet to know… Like a lead, dead, heavy weight in the solar plexus.

It’s been alovely sunny day, although the ‘classroom’ is always quite dim. The ‘classroom’is one half of a divided larger space with Mrs Addnitt’s class in one half, andmy class – Mrs Norgan’s, in the other. The door we come in through is in MrsAddnitt’s half. We hang our coats in Mrs Norgan’s half – on pegs near the messyarea. We painted and glued here. We planted a lot of things – daffodils and collias. We did a lot of writing in the mornings when I struggled to spell and a lot ofcraft. Pompoms and finger-knitting were favourites of mine. The messy tableshad a grey surface and they sat on a grey lino floor. The rest of the classroomhad a dark green carpet with a thin, light green stripe. On the opposite sideof the ‘classroom’ to Mrs Additt’s was a tank where we watched frogspawn evolvein to tadpoles and frogs. But before that tank was a small room where Igathered with all the children in my class and Mrs Norgan at the end of my lastday at that school – Maunds Wood in Harlow, Essex. I wouldn’t be going back after the summer holidays becauseour family were moving to Peterborough with the company Dad worked for. I wasgenuinely surprised to receive a large card my peers had made and signed. Ithad blue, lace flowers glued around the edge and a gold ‘M’ for Marie in thecentre. I was even more taken aback by the small card Mrs Norgan gave to me –just from her. This was handmade too. Another ‘M’ – but this had been carefully embroidered with dainty flowers. The writing inside beautiful calligraphy (which Mrs Norgan had taught me to do to improve my handwriting). I was a bit wild at in my time at that school – perhaps abit too much for the other kids at times. I could make people laugh, but then I’dbe on my own. Mrs Norgan had arranged for Mrs Hogarth (the headmistress) togive me extra lessons in spelling so I thought I was an unwanted problem. The last moments of that last day transformed the way Ithought about myself. I wouldn't share these with anyone no one else could value them as much as I do. I wouldn't take them anywhere in the real world I'd climb in the case with them and disappear into a dream.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowmidhighhigh","lowCount":6,"midCount":3,"highCount":5,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":192,"file":"marie responses/Day 13: Response","title":"Day 13: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-28 18:54:46","text":"My Traction Table: BeforeTractionAha ‘Moment’ What next? Choice points, insight into action, transit, transformation… I am the family mediator. Slapping my husband with the back of my hand. I can be violent. I need help seek it anywhere you might find it friends, family, GP, counsellor. I am dependent on my parents to care for me. Being asked to choose which parent to live with when I was 6 years old.

My new teacher praised my handwriting when we moved to Peterborough in 1988. I can do well at school. I apply myself to doing well. I transform from being a disengaged pupil to become an ambitious, high achiever. I am the centre of attention at school in Harlow. I was bullied for my accent, achievements and my appearance at school in Peterborough for 7 years. I don't belong with these people. I choose my company cautiously and need to protect myself from harm. Family give us advice, guidance and security. I am sexually abused by my uncle at age 15. My family find out when I'm 17. They don't all believe me. People with authority can be manipulative, divisive and deceitful. People don't believe young people easily. I feel ashamed when I am Naïve. I reject family members who misjudge me. I find security in my independence. I am sexually curious. I have sex with men and women. I want to be in a relationship so I have to make a choice. I prefer sex with men. I stop sleeping with women. I only have relationships with men. I need to be happy in myself before I can be with anyone else. I let Alex love me and I let myself fall in love with him. I am happy. I want to keep Alex forever. We create a home together. We travel together. We are crazy together. We are perfect together. He proposes and I agree to marry him. I am designed to carry babies and give birth. My instincts will get me through labour. It will be beautiful. The birth of my first daughter, Sophia. After 3 days of labour that I don't know how to manage. I use gas and air, pethidine and an epidural to get through it. I argue against a c-section, and give up my body to a room full of people watching a consultant violently pull my baby out with a ventouse. The cord is cut from around the baby's neck before she is born. My baby is green and needs to be resuscitated. She may have suffered brain damage. I have to learn how to be the Mother I expect to be. Motherhood is a difficult, exhausting lesson to learn when I have such high expectations. My failures make me angry and aggressive. I become depressed. I am eventually excited about the extra love I feel for my unborn baby. The birth of my second daughter, Maisie. A quick, natural birth. Loving so many people can be overwhelming. I keep running out of time to show Alex my love. We become distant.

At our last meeting, she suggested I attend less to my children and more to myself. I accepted and appreciated that advice as it 'allowed' me to give myself time and freedom for me that should be supported by my husband. In attending more to myself, I have chosen to engage more with my friends who have allowed me the time and space to share my feelings, to find my way, and to keep loving my husband. This acceptance of me for who I am, when my husband seems to have misjudged me, is the warmest affection I could wish for right now. This affection makes me feel worth loving and reminds me of the kindness have in my heart. My husband's misjudgement of me feels in opposition to acceptance. My depression (and this is the third time I've gone through it in my time with Alex) makes me behave aggressively. In the last week, I have learned that he had no idea about this he has seen the aggression as part of me and over the last 7 years, detached himself from it and me.

Do I now mention Mum's mastectomy, and Shirl going to Mrs King, and Mrs Carver coming round to give Paul and I our dinners, and being upset when I told her Mum would never pour tea leaves down the sink, like she was doing; before we went off to The Lake District, youth hosteling, six Liverpool lads in search of adventure? (While she was recovering, she let us go…)No, not now. Why not? It is not yet time, it may never be time. Finish your own journey first before you concern yourself with other people's. Anyway, she is no longer here. Okay, wise guru. (But in fact I have already told it, what I can remember.) Response to FACTI have really felt the longing to be a published writer of anything: stories, articles, poems, novels, plays, autobiographies, biographies. I have kept everything I have ever written, the most prolific being 15 articles for G& T Update, edited by Jane West who became a close friend. (Laura had some connection with the Gifted and Talented idea when she was at Warwick)The more narrative accounts of my life I have started and completed, the better, I think, I have become at making them accurate. My Truth, I think. Is to be honest, and sometimes witty, in my stories. The one point in this Project where I wasn't honest was when I put in the picture of a friend's motorbike, rather than my own, because his was more powerful and would cast me in a better light to the reader. I had to find the courage to be real. In order to tell the story properly of my wife's leaving, I devised a scenario whereby my best friend, Chris, told the story which I couldn't bear to do. I first told it to Richard Perl, the psychiatrist who saw me two years after the event on my GP's recommendation, and he seemed to understand how I felt, although he did tell me once that it was more difficult for women. In my fictionalised account, my friend, Chris, tells part of the story that I told to Richard Perl in Bedford over the course of a series of visits. Anyway I was really pleased with Chris's story which didn't appear to blame anyone, only the omniscient narrator did that, (They had worked it all out, reader.) But your view might be different, reader You might even ask, why does it matter so much? and i don't know the answer to that, but it did. I am now thinking I could get all the pieces of the story, print them out and lay them on the floor, and then turn them into cards and put them in a box, rather like B. S. Johnson did with The Unfortunates: A legendary 1960s experiment in form, The Unfortunates is B. S. Johnson's famous 'book in a box' in which all the chapters are presented unbound, to be read in any order the reader chooses. (Amazon)I would like my autobiographical narrative to consist of fragments to be assembled/disassembled in a similar fashion because i think that's what memory is fragments that can be re-assembled. It sometimes depends too on how you are feeling, just how this re-assembling takes place. Sometimes the re-assembly is more successful than others. I would say that the fictitious re-assembly I have done with Chris's help is the best to date. I feel lighter, less burdened by it. (The other image I like is that of the mosaic, the tiled floor made up of hundreds of tiny pieces, all fitting together to make the final picture. Sue and I saw some of these in Sicily and co-incidentally our next-door neighbour's father was Sicilian and a purveyor of tiles, and he sent someone to do the tiling of our conservatory floor, the room with a view that looks out over fields towards the Chilterns.)Did it work, my multiple narrative layers, my mosaic life-floor? Only you can tell me, reader. In a sense I have transformed my own life purposes, because, whatever happens next in the Project, I will never forget this journey I have been on over the 21 days, just as I never forgot the acid trip I went on in the 60s, which is recounted earlier. I hope as a result to become a better person, writer, husband, father, friend, lover, brother, colleague, teacher, pupil, all the roles we might assign ourselves in life. Does it have wider implications, less personal, more embracing of the world in general? I would like to link my experiences through literature, as I tried to do in the Aarhus paper, to seek out some kind of universal truth that art can improve our human lot.

XResponse to Day 18For some reason all this that I have watched reminds of the opening of E. M. Fordter' novel, The Longest Journey, so I hope it's okay if I run with this for a bit and see what happens. Does an object or place still exist if you are not there? That is the basic premise of the novel's beginning. Fascinating. We have just been walking on Bempton CliffsHow do I know that my Bempton Cliffs were the same as Sue's Bempton Cliffs. If they were the same why wasn't everybody freaking out like I was? They weren't the same cliffs as Paul, my brother's cliffs. For him they are places where sea birds nest, but an artist like David Hockney who lives nearby in Bridlington might see them in a different way through an artistic filter. What does that mean? Now you know that he likes light and used California for his art. What you didn't know then, when you talked to him in the Midland Arms, Hendon, in 1969, where he had come to drink with you and Pete Patston, (who I still see and who sadly now has Parkinson's), and Derek Miles and Eric Punax, was that David Hockney was gay. Would it have changed anything if you had known that? Would there have been the same male camaraderie as there was that night drinking in The Midland Arms after he had talked to the college Literary Society about his art. 'Peter getting out of Nick's Pool' is actually, now you look at it, quite a gay statement, but it didn'seem so then when you first saw it in an exhibition in Liverpool. It just seemed Iike: One boy getting out of another boy's poolThere was nothing obviously sexual about it, although for a gay person there probably was. The owner of the Greek cafe who forced himself up against me from behind and tried to push himself against my buttocks, making me shout, No! And thrust my elbows back againt him, sharply. Did he expect me to want what he was doing? Perhaps he did. He fancied me and he attempted a…? A what? Would it have been rape had he succeeded? I suppose it would. I have now talked about the idea, (not the incident with the cafe owner). to Sue who can't see why I am making a connection between Forster's philosophical idea in the novel and David Hockney's gayness. Perhaps I just couldn't cope with the idea of being fancied by a gay man. Despite, reader, being somewhat proud of my feminine type sensibilitiesMaybeMy past of what I saw as a betrayal by Viv has haunted me for many years. In what follows I learn to dance away from my sadness. Dance provides me with exercise, bodily movement, that is touching or avoiding other people. It can be playful which I love being. For example at the conference in Canterbury there was an all-woman dance group that took us through a lot of movement activities. At some point, and I can't really remember why, everyone, men included was given a huge wide skirt to wear and suddenly along with Linden and this very tall Dutch man I was part of this group of mainly women, all dancing in our huge skirts and feeling free. I loved it. I like playing roles. I liked imagining I was Katy in What Katy Did. I liked imagining I was Viv in my story Geraldine (1975) This is the first paragraph: Geraldine Chapman knocked lightly on the glass-fronted door. Behind her the rain continued to fall and an occasional drip fell from the lintel, cold and hard against her forehead. She shook the sodden black umbrella in her other hand and knocked again, somewhat harder, crouching against the doorway to avoid the rain. At last, after what seemed to Geraldine an interminable length of time, a dim light came on in the hallway and she could discern a vague shape approaching behind the frosted glass. Geraldine picked up her suitcase from the step and, wiping the damp hair away from her face with her coat sleeve, managed to summon a smile of greeting. I like trying out different teaching roles: I have been a General Subjects teacher; a Secondary English teacher,; the Head of Science at a 9-13 Middle School; a teacher of Science to Primary School teachers; a teacher ol Primary Science to infant and nursery school children; a teacher of, and co-ordinator of ideas for, Gifted and Talented children; a trainer of Teaching Assistants; and now a teacher of English Literature to adults. I suppose if there is a common factor it is my love of performance. I get a 'high' out of teaching a 'good lesson' but have never really explored why this should be. The act of teaching itself is a very powerful one. It is a powerful role. Last week, for some reason, I got talking to Emilie in the paper shop about writing poetry. She intimated that she would like to see my poems so I sent her For Hadi and Every object is the story of my life, which she really liked. I followed up, explaining about Ghazals in Persian poetry, the teacher in me wanting to communicate some beauty to this girl/woman who takes the money for my newspaper order each week. I sense that Emillie is in a liminal state, being between girl and woman. Perhaps she will turn into a butterfly… Do you remember Pete when Alan in Broad Green Hospital talked to you about Dylan Thomas and T. S. Eliot. This was during a routine cartilage operation and what an effect that had transformational. You never looked back. Friday8am. It is morning. I have just read this lovely story in the Buckingham Advertiser about Gemma. Gemma was in the New Inn with £250 in her handbag, the deposit for a new flat that she was moving into. However, during a fun evening the £250 was stolen without her knowing. When she discovered this the next day Gemma was distraught, and put it on Face-Book to shame the person into returning the money. However, the post was seen by Penny who suggested that everyone chip in a pound. Gemma's friend Julia, whose daughter had tragically died from meningitis in 2014, also stepped in to help. Julia set up a Go-Fund Me page on Facebook. Within half an hour more than enough money had been raised by the people of Buckingham so that Gemma did not have to cancel her house move. Isn't that a lovely story, reader? Did I say something to Helen's Mum at the meeting over the chess pieces about girls taking over the world? Or women, but aren't they doing it already really with their kindness, and their lovingness, even when their men are brutal, (and maybe stole £250) no that's not fair, Pete, come on back to reality please. 9amNow Sue and I are off to MIlton Keynes for a shopping day. The MK shopping centre is lovely, and don't be put off by stories of concrete cows, they're lovely too. Go and see them some time. But now I want to tell you about my day, Alice, because today I was a dancer and I think you will like it because you like dancing. I noticed you see that every time I put on my hat, the one in the picture with Sue, I felt confident and wanted to perform, so when Sue went for her eye test I thought I would imagine I was a dancer. So, wearing my hat, I danced down to Debenhams. There I bought not one, not two, but three pairs of trousers and danced with male and female shop assistants while choosing them. Then, on the way out I saw a shirt that I loved and, feeling like Richard Gere in American Gigolo, I danced back to the changing rooms, tried it on and bought it (as well as a belt to hold the trousers up.)I then danced over to Specsavers to meet up with Sue, praised her choice of frames, and went out into the centre to sit down while she paid. This took ages because these things do sometimes, and I observed people passing and tried to decide whether they were dancing, or not dancing. Some were, definitely, and some were not. Sue came out and I told her that today I was a dancer and that we would dance over to Cotswold to. buy me a rucksack, because the one I have is giving me tennis elbow and it's twenty years old. And so we danced into the car park and into the car and across three lanes of traffic to the Cotswold roundabout, and then into the shop itself. Even though I had told Sue I was a dancer, she seemed to accept it and not treat me like a nutcaseAnd then you had the best dance of all with the shop assistant who knew a lot about rucksacks and the reasons why a badly fitting one might cause tennis elbow, and who patted and adjusted, and loosened, and tightened until the chosen rucksack felt really comfortable on you, so that you went with him to the till and produced the Gorphwyfsa Club (walking group) membership card that entitled you to 20% discount and said, Thanks Dan, which was on his name badge. And then you danced into Costa coffee with Sue and had lunch, and then drove down to the care home in Newport Pagnell and sat in the car with the door half open while she went to return her uniform to the manager, because she has now left this job for a new one. 'And did the dancing stop then? 'Yes, for a moment, and as you sat with the door half open, listening to The Corrs, Her, CD, singing 'My Lagan Love' you remembered how much you loved being with Sue. When Lagan stream sing lullaby Then blows a lily fair When twilight gleam is in her eyes The night is on her hair And like a love sick lenanshee She hath my heart in thrall No life have I, no liberty With love is lord of all. Well I don't know what you think of that, reader. Not exactly free love is it? But at that moment in time, wearing the dancing hat, and thinking of Langan love, it became a special moment. A day that started well just got better. 'Have just showed this to Sue and she liked it but wondered why I had used you instead of I in the two paragraphs. What does the editor think? Also have I lost my original point about betrayal? Do I just dance away to escape from it and why anyway shouldn't we? Surely it is better than screaming and crying? Have you just moved this? Are you watching me my Muse? I think you are. P. And it's lovely. EndHey Pete.

I go on to read more about her and find words like villanelle and rubaiyat, both forms I love, how Wendy Cope taught us villanelle and how I have that book about the Omar Khayam, a rubaiyat, which I now can't find, but it has the lines about paradise being 'a glass of wine, a book of verse and thou' which sort of contradicts the idea that the true subject of poetry is loss. My poem about Bex was walking with her after school picking flowers and wondering how I could bear the loss of her. Yet the poem was really about how I could never lose her: 'I found a clump of linden/Showing you the seeds small parachutes. /Those that the wind would blow down from the trees, /That might be blown from our hands if we breathed. ' It was a sonnet. Somehow the form makes the ache more bearable. I now look at Mimi Khalvati's verse and make some copies. She likes sonnets too. Just had a thought now, talking to Sue on the phone that this research could be seen as 'free form', inviting us to express ourselves however we want to with just triggers that we can pick up and run with. Seeing a poem on a tube is like that, you pick it up and remember it, it is stored in the mind to be used when needed. The spaces I'm not writing in is where I live, yes eating a sandwich now, thinking about how the ironing is waiting. I remember Mum doing this and everything seemed right: When I was a boy/Everything was right/Everything was right… but She said, I don't understand what you said/I said no, no, no you're wrong. The answer is to listen to the song… iron in hand. Finding out more about Mimi Khalvati I came across this. Now to write one perhaps. Hers are lovely.

All the senses, including vision, can be regarded as extensions of the sense of touch – as specialisations of the skin. ' (Pallasmaa, J 2012: 42)mTo help re-imagine my own birth I turned to two poems the well known Prayer Before Birth by Louis MacNeice and the lesser known Vision and Prayer by Dylan Thomas. Both writers designed their poems in womb shapes because they were trying to imagine the other of themselves and both poems are beautiful examples of men trying to grasp that truth, which they themselves cannot experience in the same way as a woman can. When Bex was born it was amazing for me because Viv and I had gone to ante-natal classes together and I had learned how to coach her with the breathing. I think I was very confident that I could help her with this. I of course would feel no pain, except sharing hers. This is the nearest I have got to being in the womb, seeing my own daughter born, and oh what an amazing and unforgettable moment there in the delivery room together. You might think the dream was beginning but as Dylan Thomas says: 'And the whole pain/Flows open/And I/Die. ' If you look at the poem, you will see that the shape is the birth canal… Or Bob Dylan's 'He not busy being born/ is busy dying' from 'It's all right ma, I'm only bleeding'Or John Lennon's 'Soon as you're born they make you feel small… ' from Working Class HeroAnd now I think of my mother, so frail yet in-domitable, so strong to protect us after Dad's early death. She carried me, her first born, within her, and naturally wanted me to do great things in the world, solve its problems. I was always going to disappoint her. And yet my daughter, so wonderful, so positive about birthing her children. I read the wonderful book she had about natural birth after she had had Alistair, I read it almost without stopping. And Tamar, the water birth. Viv might have had that if time slipped. I've just asked Bex. The book was 'hypnobirthing' by Marie Montana. 'i carry your heart with me (i carry it in/my heart)i am never without it (anywhere/i go you go,…)'Is that what it is like to carry a child inside you?

Now go Magpie and look for other trinkets, are you going to bring me sorrow or joy? And I want it to be joy, yes joy because I have been so sad, and did your wing just flap then in the corner of my eye and tell me it could never be so good as it was behind the shelters on the prom. And where are you now? what happened to you, and did it mean as much to you, that moment behind the shelters? It's Malc now Magpie, you are bringing him to me in the photo and he was my best friend and we shared everything and we met Pat and Joan together and Pat ditched me after three weeks but it didn't matter. (Can you bear all this stuff about girls, yes I think you can because you have listened before) so come on Magpie, take me to Malc who was so good looking that I envied him and with Joan he told me how she went to his house, and his mum was out, and she let him touch her breasts and she had dark curly hair and a blue coat and they loved each other for months and then his mother found out she was a Catholic and pulled down the roof on him, and my mother never would do that. So come on Magpie, take me away from this, take me to Beryl. And Steve and I were playing table tennis in the youth club, not ours where they had given us sex education, but Mossley Hill, and they were watching us and we talked, yes talked Magpie we actually talked to girls. And afterwards I said, can I walk you to the bus stop and we kissed there. (Oh it sounds so corny now, doesn't it Magpie? But don't laugh) because Beryl, she was round and soft like girls are, and I had seen Gilbo hitting her with his bag at Atlantic House waiting for the bus, in her uniform with her green beret, pinned at the sides with clips. Girls. And Gilbo wore a jacket with THEM written on the back in thick blue pen and he was hitting Beryl, hitting her with his bag. Did he hate her softness, Magpie? Oh tell me because when I knew her better and we would sit on the couch with Mum in the other room, and she had the skirt with ribbed stripes, I said what I had seen at Atlantic House and Gilbo, before I knew her, when she was other, but she didn't want to talk about it, and oh the beret Magpie with the clips at the sides. But I ended it didn't I from the phone box at the top of the road, even though I had taken her home every Saturday and watched Match of the Day with her Dad while she and her Mum made tea, yes I ended it because it was enough and She had let me touch her breasts (are we so terrible Magpie, us men? Because it is so powerful the wanting, the needing, the beret with the clips, do you know that?) and I wanted to be free again because now I knew a bit about girls, and they were not like Katie from Susan Coolidge, they were real, oh so real. The Magpie looks again at the notes and swoops on Peacocks, and it is Gill and Dave and it is Bedford, Peacocks, an auction house and they lived near there, and I had met Dave at The Queens Head where he played guitar, and both of us, our wives had left us for others, and that is so hard Magpie, that is so hard to bear, but I asked Jim if I could read my poems, and he said even if it was written on a bit of bog roll I could do it, so I did and Dave played his. songs and I read poems while they, the people listening to Dave, went for a beer, so I began to write for them and I got better and I made them laugh and they listened. to me. Thatched Cottage Blues, they loved that one, 'She dreamed of a little cottage/ Of straw instead of slate/ A wagon wheel beside the door/And roses round the gate. ' And I made them laugh, yes laugh, laugh with me at what had happened. 'They moved in during summer/And lived in married bliss/ He never left for work without giving her a kiss.' And although they knew the awfulness, must have known Magpie, that I was bleeding there, It's all right Ma, they laughed the loudest when I read 'She started to get restless/She thought she'd run away/And marry an accountant/At least they get good pay.' And if you are listening to this Magpie and I know you are, the punch line, 'He woke one day to find her gone/A note told him the news/All that was left was a heap of dead rats/And thatched cottage blues.' should make you laugh or weep, or both, because he had loved girls this man, and they became women and they had children and they wanted accountants for God's sake not poets. But Gill wanted Dave, Gill who was attractive and who wrote funny plays about tampons and being a woman and performed them with a friend at the workshop, where I read my poetry, and Dave and I watched, and she liked Dave, who was kind and who wasn't only interested in her body, and they sang together her song, What I Want, which she and Dave had written and had practised in my garage with the empty cardboard egg trays hung down from the ceiling as baffles and performed, and she married him. I was their best man, Magpie, and I told jokes at the wedding and I was proud to do this for them because we were friends and I had thought marriage was for life and it wasn't for me but it might be for them. I had to wait and learn more about girls becoming women before I married again, and I did, I did learn more, but you will have to wait now Magpie if you want to hear about it because I'm tired and I seem to be writing the novel that I always wanted to write so fly away please.

The StoryMy daughter would come to visit me every other Saturday and I would return her to her mother and stepfather on the Sunday morning. I almost always made her vegetarian spaghetti for Saturday night from the ingredients pictured, because her school was vegetarian. The spaghetti was the long kind in the blue wrapper which is now difficult to get. She often mentions it to me these days now that she has two children of her own, and she talks about making it again. I think it is the only meal I have ever actually 'invented', as it were. I am now going to chop up the ingredients and cook it. I will let you know how I get on, with another photo. Oh yes, there is always. Cheddar cheese on top, no Parmesan then, or as I used to call it 'parmesian' which always used to annoy her 'Oh, Daddy! 'I can still hear it. 'And crusty bread, ' she said when. I asked her in a face-time message this morning what the ingredients were, but I honestly don't remember that. Memory is such an intriguing thing, and do two people ever have the same memories of an event, or a meal, or a shared meal? I wonder, Alice in Wonderland, I wonder… The meal as eaten by Sue and I. She did some chopping, and i also did some and then the cooking, while she grated the cheese and cut the crusty bread. Which plate was hers do you think? An ocean of wine if you get the right answer! PS. I didn't have wine when I was cooking it for Becky. And now the second instalment of the Pete menu. This time it's steak and sautéed potatoes designed for the Saturday nights when Becky didn't come to visit and I didn't have a girlfriend to hold my hand, or didn't have a blind date to go on, or a dining club evening, run by Geoff, to negotiate. The steak is cooked perfectly, the best this side of London as I say to my butcher and he rejoins, No, I cook the best steak this side of London. Our male horns are locked you see. Then the sautéed potatoes are drawn from the deep fat fryer, which has overflowed because you haven't changed the oil recently, and Sue, now she is here, drains the broccoli, and scoops out the onions and mushrooms which you have fried but which she has chopped. And supper is eaten, accompanied by a glass or two, or even three of red wine, tonight a Shiraz which you have while Sue, who doesn't like red wine, has prosecco. What was that line about Jack Spratt? Pete, shut up, just put the photo in. Okay, and by the way Sue has had chicken.

In August this year eight of us are to meet there again. I go back there, the past, frequently, trying to make sense of the emotions caused falling in love, being left by Viv, my daughter being born. And now her son and her daughter. The incredibleness of birth. Her first one in Malaysia where they have these ideas about confinement and no-one can visit for a month. And Viv hated that because she wanted to share it with Bex. Me, I accepted what she wanted. I trusted her. When Sue and I finally flew out to see baby it was good. I held him and danced with him singing. When we got back to England I had this extraordinary dream of Viv's leaving me so many years ago. It was as if it was happening again and I was frightened. And now the next baby, a little girl, that she had in England, bringing over the Malaysian midwife that they trusted to supervise the confinement. It was painless for her. I was so glad for Bex.

Where I was growing up in Liverpool the neighbourhood was very tied to the church, not Catholic but straight C of E, and we went to it, not Mum, she just sent us, and we went to Sunday School and Bible Class and OMG there is another girl story here, reader, but not now, not yet. Rosalyn, I will leave you asleep for now, although you did once wake up when I was 50+ and we finally talked by email, and I told Sue about it, but first the chrysalis breaking open, come on Pete, emerge! We were in the Church Lads Brigade, Malc, Steve, Rund, me, my brother, Paul, and Peter Rimmer, and we played footee, and handball and 'boom coming over' and drilled Attention! Right dress! And marched, marched, marched. And, reader, I played a snare drum and I loved it, and would be in the front of the march, after Ace Burnham who swung the mace, and I would play the two threes, holding the sticks up under my nose, and we would start marching. Outside Liverpool's Anglican Carhedral, we would gather: RatatatatatatatatatRatatatatatatatatatAnd then the bugles would blow and the bass drum played by Clifford Hannah would keep the rhythm: Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! And it was beautiful… Now reader the CLB was run by men who were quasi-military, because WWII was not long over, and some of them needed a role, and they were good hearted men but they had been soldiers, and they wanted everybody else to be soldiers, soldiers of Christ, perhaps, but still soldiers. But the butterflies were emerging from their chrysalises because their soft bodies had been listening to songwriters like Bob Dylan who said that killing people wasn't really such a good thing, even if they were soldiers, because lots of other people got killed too. And wasn't Jesus against killing? You see the caterpillar's problem don't you reader? So one day Pete, Malc, Steve, Rund. Paul. Pete's brother, and Peter Rimmer, went to Major Howard and told him that they had decided that war was not a good thing and that they were leaving the CLB. And Major Howard was angry, and enraged and went purple in the face and condemned them, utterly condemned them but it was no good, the war was over, and their life was just beginning. So the butterflies emerged from their chrysalises and fluttered away. and I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes/Riding shotgun in the skies/Turning into butterflies above our nation -((Woodstock by Joni Mitchell) Please add the recording of Woodstock, Alice, if you can, when you do the noticing for this one. Next DayI wake up and somehow I am singing: 'You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant. ' Do you know the song Alice because if you don't you could listen. It is a song by Argo Guthrie, son of Woody, and Woody was Bob Dylan's mentor, as Bob Dylan was my mentor. and Bob Dylan went to visit Woody in hospital when he was dying from complications due to Huntington's disease. It is good to visit the dying and my Dad was in hospital in Stanley Park, Liverpool, suffering kidney failure from the multiple sclerosis that had afflicted him for eight years. Mum took me to the hospital to visit him and I took with me to show him a stool I had made in the woodwork class with Mr MacDonald, who wore a tobacco coloured overall and had a white moustache, and was good with his hands, like Dad had been good with his hands, when he made us toys, castles, garages and cranes, in the shed from his Hobbies magazines. And I think Dad smiled as he looked at my stool, but his mouth, which had once held a pipe filled with St Bruno flake, was now slack. One night, reader, it must have been late July, 1962, Mum came into our bedroom and said that she wanted to talk to us. We had divans, Pal and I, and Mum sat on one of them and asked us how we would feel if God took Dad away from us? I can't remember how we responded, we probably cried, but softly. The next day Mum told us that Dad had died in the night. Paul was 11, I was 12, Shirley was 4. Mum was 37. Nothing much was then said about Dad's death to his children. We didn't go to the funeral, but I remember people in black in the front room eating cake and drinking sherry. I suspect that at some point Mum told us that we must be breve, the same words I had said to Becky when I really meant I had to be brave, not her. But in this case Mum really had to be brave oh very brave, and she was. And in September 1962 I struggled up the road to the bus for school in the mornings and never said anything to anybody about what had happened to Dad, except once, at the front of an Atlantean bus, looking out of the front window, and Graham Blackburn (Blackie) suddenly asked me what my Dad did, and I said, 'He's dead'; and Blackie looked surprised because I think I was choking, but luckily the bus then came to my stop and I got up, got off, and walked quickly down the road to 24 Stratford, our house. And eventually Peter started going to Quaker meetings, but not yet, Not until he met Sue, but that's a long time away, about 30 years after he had banged the drum in the CLB, which he loved doing, until he left as I have said. Because Peter now began to question received religion and when his best friend Malc came to his door one evening and told him that his dad had died from a heart attack, he began to question it even more. And then when his friend Dave Smith, who later was on the beach in St Ives when he met Viv, and who had chosen her friend, Sheila, because she had 'big tits', leaving Peter with Viv who didn't, but who was pretty and who had studied Russian like Peter had, (and they could write to each other, reader, in a secret code because Russian letters are different). Hey can you get to the point please, what about his friend, Dave Smith? Okay, I will. His friend Dave Smith, whose mother had four children, three of whom were younger and girls, also had a heart attack and died. So Peter thought, Fuck this and stopped believing in God. And another caterpillar went into its. chrysalis and another flying creature emerged from the soup, but this time not a butterfly. This time a moth. But still quite beautiful even though Peter's Mum hated them, hated their large soft bodies that had emerged from the primal soup, just like Peter had emerged from her as a boy. and she didn't understand boys even though she had been s tomboy because nobody had told her, and her husband was dead.

Okay okay, I'll tell you a story, reader, this is a story about the bubbling hormonal soup that is in people when they are young, when they are in that liminal state to which you, Alice, have added such interesting pieces in your notes, and which I only came across when teaching Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald, not to adolescents but to retired people in their 70s and 80s, because you never really lose the memory of that time when you were liminal. So here is the story, reader which I hope you are now eager to hear, and I think in it's own way it is quite lovely, not like Dad's death or Vivien's betrayal. Okay, here goes. Peter went to Bible Class and was taught about the bible by an earnest young woman called Heather, and surely, reader, as Heather sat there leading the class, she must have seen that these young people were bubbling with hormones… There was Peter, Paul, his brother, Malc, Steve, Peter Rimmer, Dave Smith, the twins Jean snd Gaye Smith, (no relation) who were oh so pretty, reader, you had never seen such pretty girls as those two. Except for Rosalyn who wore a cerise coloured coat and had soft fair hair which touched its collars, and whose lips Peter would have longed to kiss when he knew what kissing was. And it wasn't quite the sort of hormones that had Peter reaching for his copy of Penthouse in the night, the one that he had stolen, yes stolen reader, Peter had actually picked up the magazine together with the newspaper he was buying at a bookstall in Liverpool town centre and had paid (for the paper) and walked away with the magazine beneath the newspaper, waiting for the call behind him of, You thief, come back! But that call never came, because perhaps the woman on the bookstall, the same age as his mother, knew what boys were like, unlike his mother, and so let him take the magazine away to look at in the quiet of his soul, because these were pretty tasteful magazines in those days, reader, not like today, and he needed to know what these, these other, looked like beneath… Hey that's enough, Can we get back to Rosalyn, pleaseWell that's the point, don't you see? She was the other this Rosalyn, was the other. And every Sunday evening after the afternoon bible class, Peter would take out his Letts diary, and write down in it, in one of the many-coloured inks of the special pen he had with the six barrels, which rotated until you had found the one you wanted, and wrote down how much you loved her, this girl who you had never even spoken to, just looked at in the class, across the circle, and longed to speak to. And reader, you are not going to believe this, but years later when I was married to Sue, whom I love very deeply, I contacted Rosalyn through a website called Friends Reunited, and wrote to her and told her of the crush I had had on her all those years ago, and she, now Lyn, replied, and we exchanged a number of emails about our lives, and what had happened to us since the bible class. This is from one: 'Subject: Re: Advanced Bible ClassesDear Peter, Things have changed, but not totally… My younger son, Stuart, who has just turned 17, hasn't yet discovered the joys of girls, at least not to go out with! He's just started at Bradford College, and must at least mix with the opposite sex, but that's all. My older son, who has just had his nineteenth birthday, now has a life of his own mainly in Leeds, although he's supposed to be living at home! I have no idea what he gets up to, but at least I do see him from time to time, which I wouldn't were he away! He only started going out at nearly 18, so from that point of view I haven't had a lot of hassle. (Perhaps I'm just lucky. Do you think it's hereditary?) Presume the relationship thing will strike them at some time. My own marriage ended in 1995 after 20 years. My ex drank rather a lot ! And it made him very verbally abusive.

Now have 8 weeks to do. Best wishes, Lyn. (P. S. Wonder if they knew at Bible Class that we were into meeting the opposite sex! Must it have shown?)'That's all now reader. We had many further exchanges, Lyn and I, and I sent her a book I had published about Gifted and Talented children. I don't know why. But that girl with the beret in the picture.

No, there are no twin souls, there is just you and sometimes companions for the journey men, women, girls, boys, children, lovers, friends, even cats, yes, I learned that when I was in Ireland on my own, having said to Mariaok I'll go alone, and it was better, it really was. I have arrived at Cork. I slept well, for me, in an upright chair in the passenger lounge and was first out of the ferry at 7am. Now I am sitting in Sheila's tourist hostel, surrounded by crowds of travelling people from various parts of the world. It is looking good. I've just had a . lovely hot shower and a change of clothes. There is Irish folk music playing, Mary Black I'm told, a traditional singer. I'm about to head off down to The Living Tradition [a folk music shop] to find out more. (Irish Notebook Summer 1994) This was my older/younger self, my older/younger self realising that his life would be so much better if he stopped worrying about not having a girlfriend and started enjoying being himself. And then of course it happened didn't it, as it always does, because the gods are kind and although they laugh at us they love us a little too a year after I returned from Ireland, with a farewell bottle of Jamieson's for Maria, and having had a fantastic time being on my own, I met someone. But that's another story, reader. I haven't really kept to the plan, Alice, which I wrote down before I went on the walk that you suggested. But I don't think you'll mind, because I think, though I haven't met you, that you are a nice person. And I do hope it (the story) made you smile.

Do you want to come outside and look at Them with me? Have you seen the stars tonight? Do you want to come outside and keep me company? This is a song by Grace Slick and Paul Kantner when the world seemed possible and to be full of love, Alice, and I know you want that too, want the world to be full of love, because you have said so, and yesterday there has been a terrible bombing in Manchester, which you mentioned in your introduction to our day with the stars. (And do you know, Alice, Sue protected me from knowing about this terrible thing) until I watched the news in the evening, and then I saw the horror of what had happened, the horror, and I am a Pisces, the 12th sign, and I have already looked at that in your notes, Alice, because that is easy to read, The Moon in Pisces I think. Is the most like me. You have put it all before us and l will be just like the Magpie again and look for the glittering objects among the brokenness of the world, like the bombing just now, and look for the love that is also here, because I have been there and seen that love can be possible, and when Paul and Grace sang that song, there was also horror in the world and a little girl ran down a road in Vietnam burning from napalm, and we saw it a lot of us, and many could only turn away, but I couldn't because I am a Piscean and I am sensitive, yes sensitive, not always a good thing to be in a world of sometimes horror, where people hurt each other, badly, deliberately, yes deliberately. How can anyone do that, such a thing. Like Mr Keffard did to Mrs Keffard in an earlier story that I put here. And she ran down our hall with a plate of dinner and tripped and fell and the dinner went everywhere. But Mum helped her, because Mum had love, some of that love you were talking about. When Mum died Shirl read at the church service about love from the bible: 'Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does nor insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things ' 1 Corinthians 13. And you know something about love, don't you, when you held your sister and her still born baby in Australia, because I noticed that. You said I notice things and I do and I know you loved her, and it must have been terribly hard for her, but you helped, yes you helped because love helps people doesn't it, helps them carry on? How do I know this? Because I do, because I have met loving people, and I have wondered, yes wondered how you can turn not loving people into loving people. Can you do it by example? like Jesus or any of the world's religious figures? My sister can, I think you would like her. And now I must go and play amongst the stars for a bit, because the trouble with being a Piscean is that the world can overwhelm you sometimes, and I watched a programme yesterday about three girls in Rochdale, you will know the story l'm sure, and it is a cruel, hateful story, almost unbearable, but sometimes we have to watch unbearable things because we can change them, and they were trying to change them, those unbearable things, the good people in Rochdale, and there are some but nobody heard them, nobody listened. When I watch the rest of it sometime, but not today, because today I am a child on the starship, I will see how those good people did it. Why not today, Why not? Because today I want to play amongst the stars, and I want to do that, play amongst the stars, like a child, a child of the universe. 'We could go, we could go… Oh, oh but I want to know, will you come with me? ' These are fragments if song that I heard and listened to a long time ago, and there is one song that I remember more, because it is about peace and love and I will Give you some words of it: 'Well, if you smile st me you know I will understandBecause that is something everybody everywhere does in the same language… And I can see by your coat my friend that you're from the other side, there's just one thing I have to know, can you tell me please who won? And you can share some of my purple berries, Well I've been eating them for six or seven weeks nowHaven't got sick onceProbably keep us both alive! This is all from memory because the song is in my head, and it is a lovely song to listen to when the world is overwhelming. Wooden Ships by CSNY is now playing softly in Peter's background. You can hear the creaking of the sails. And now I'd better start the day and I feel good, but the world is out there, and us dreamers have to ground ourselves sometimes, otherwise we would just float away into space, just float away to the starsThat's a Piscean for you, (laughter) Song'Goe, and catche a falling starre, Get with child a mandrake roote, Tell me, where all past yeares are, Or who cleft the devil's foot, Teach me to heare Mermaides singing, Or to keep off envies stinging, And finde What windeServes to advance an honest minde. ' John DonneNow John Donne was a poet as you know, and if you're ever unsure what it's like for a man to be in love, just read him, The Sunne Rising, say, or The Goode Morrow. I said this to Laura, your friend, when we were on the train out of Copenhagen with others hanging on the straps with the train rattling along, because she likes John Donne, Laura does, and she smiled. But I know now Laura was still grieving deep inside for her Dad, which she told me, because people want to share things like grief, and she had read a book which helped her with that grief, which was the point of my paper at Aarhus, that through literature we can share things, and understand ourselves and our grieving, and our loving, and that is why I am doing this with you because it is similar Art is the nearest thing to life. (Eliot) and you are an artist. Gosh what a lot of thoughts, Alice. Time to go shopping with Sue and a cup of coffee in the new coffee shop in town! See you laterNow I'm back and looking at my P. C. 'The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, /But in ourselves, that we are underlings. 'And you have done a chart for me about my stars and I will look at it and try to understand it, I will, but later. We can't blame the stars, that you have shown us in your chart, only ourselves, only ourselvesBut that requires a lot of self-knowledge. But before I do any self-knowledge stuff, I have to tell you about my morning, because today I am in a starship and it's exciting and fun and I have interacted significantly with at least three people in Buckingham that I didn't know before, and Sue has been with me, because she has taken the day off, and we have had lovely time together, and I haven't read the paper in the coffee bar which I usually do, because the coffee bar is new, and Sue is my friend. And I will tell you this, that after coffee we went to the library and I was helping Sue choose a book, because she is not a reader like me, and she went to the shelves to look and I was sitting at a table, and suddenly across from me there was a sound, a musical sound, and I looked up because strangely us hearing-lost people are sensitive to sounds. And the woman across from me in a chair, about 50 with glasses was answering, you've guessed it, a mobile phone. And I listened, I couldn't help it, I listened and she wasn't hiding the conversation she was having and I heard the words, 50, and redundant, and heart operation and I thought about that. What is she saying to this person, another woman, because I can hear the voice but not the words. And Sue comes back and shows me her book and borrows my ticket and goes to the desk, and then I look up and the woman smiles at me, a small, sad smile, but an important smile, because there is a connection between us about being human, and I don't know her story, but I am human, just like her. And Sue comes back again with my ticket and her book, and we go out of the libtrary into the sunshine. And there are two more stories from this morning, but I won't tell you them, because they are not as important as this one which I chose for you, because the one I chose for you was about two people recognising each other for a moment, a brief moment, a human moment. And it's time for lunch'Full speed ahead captain, full speed ahead. 'Lunch is over and the starship is off this afternoon to London, where I am going to a new/old friend's book launch at a club, Gerry's Club, in Dean Street where I have never been, and I am excited, very excited because I'm going by train and I have got my rail pass, like I had my Ameripass to go on the Greyhound bus in America, and it is good to be a child sometimes and explore a bit more of the world.. Goodbye Captain, see you later, l'm going on the small ship on my own to a new planet, and I'll see you tomorrow for some more on the project which is great as you can probably hear from the child in me Singing","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":14,"midCount":6,"highCount":6,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":213,"file":"peter responses/Day 8: Response","title":"Day 8: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-29 15:06:07","text":"Response I was reading Bella's book on Sound and she was talking about the strange sound world that us hard of hearing people inhabit. She was talking about the sounds of London, the underground the overground, the ambulance sirens, the police stopping you, walking, on your bicycle in your car, a shelll against that noise. I started thinking about the acid trip that Viv and I took at Lesley and Phil's… And then suddenly the rainbow image came in from Alice and I thought I'd tell the story of that trip-'She comes in colours everwhere/she combs her hair/she's like a rainbow… ' Well where will this go? I'll try it -I had sent her a letter after coming back from America, hardly a day passes when I don't think of you, and we met under the clock at Waterloo Station as we had always done in the past, and I hadn't seen her for a year but she was still the same, and we got the train to Bromley, where they lived and had lunch together and the day went on and night came and we lay down together on the floor under some blankets: 'She's like a rainbow'And of course we loved each other as we had so many times before and I wondered whether she had been with anyone else because I had been insanely jealous, incredibly possessive. She's like a rainbowAnd yet I was the one who had finished it because l wanted to be with Jo, Jackie's sister, and then as soon as I was with Jo. I knew it didn't work and I was sorry because she had cried on the platform at Waterloo when I said that I didn't want to see her again and just wanted to be free. And then there was the postal strike and there were no letters so I couldn't tell her I was wrong, and so a few months went by and when I phoned her she had met someone else because of course she would do, you fool, she was so pretty.. She comes in colours everywhereShe combs her hairShe's like a rainbowSo then I went to America withTony and Jill from University and they both copped off with someone straight away and, of course, l didn't. So I went round Times Square which was full of hard core 'girlie' mags and film booths with men in dark glasses on high stools behind the counters, and I was drawn to it but at the same time I was sickened. But I did meet Arthur who was a friend of Arlene, who Tony was now with, and Arthur drove a yellow taxi in New York and tried to show me how to pick up girls by winding the window of your car down and calling to them but we never picked up any though. Riders on the StormRiders on the StormInto this house were bornInto this worldwere thrownLike a dog without a boneAn actor out on loanRiders on the stormThen I worked for Leviton's warehouse in Brooklyn for a bit, making up orders of electrical. components, driving a pallet truck, and it was the evening shift and I had to collect the supper orders from the Greek cafe, and once the owner of the cafe sexually assaulted me and I didn't tell anybody. And then Sue Kelly in Liverpool wrote to me and told me I had failed my degree so I had to go back home. But now Viv and I were at Lesley and Phil's and they had woken us up and given us a sugar cube each and the trip began… I had tried it once before and everything was heightened, time ceased to exist, colours were intense and vivid where we were. And then we went outside and Viv and Lesley went on the swings in the park and they were like two rag dolls, and the grass was so green. What you going to do when you see your lady rolling? What you going to do when you see your lady strollingOn the deck of a starship with her head hooked in Andromeda? And time stopped but we had to go back on the train to Waterloo because of her Dad, and I was thinking will anyone notice as we made our way across London, and I was scared that something would happen to one of us. But it didn't and we got our trains and I got back to Burnt Oak, and people were in the flats but I didn't tell them what had happened, except Chris, because I liked him, and I was guilty about Addie because I knew she liked me. And when Viv came to the parry at the weekend, and wore Tony's Afghan coat. I saw that Addie was crying becausel she realised we were together and she was crying and I was sorry. Like a dog without a boneSo I walk down to the shops in the rain because I said I would do it, still fuelled by the Benzedrine of the night before(Not really, reader, because I actually need things to calm me down rather than hype me up) and I return, having had half the contents of the rivers in Buckinghamshire dumped on me. And on my walk I was thinking of Bella's book about Sound and how I had got the sounds confused even then when I was 20, because I thought that Brian Jones was singing, 'Have you seen the Lady Pharaoh?, and not, Have you seen the lady fairer? Which he was. But The Lady Pharoah was better for me because she was stately and beautiful. And to be honest I had very little idea about women at all. Lady Madonna was my mother, yes, and Times Square was the harlot centre of New York, and where was Viv in all this? I didn't know but, like Lydgate's Rosamond, she was pretty, and so reader, I married her. And what about. Trump, a man who surrounds himself with attractive women as if to prop himself up, and who is abusive to them as I remember Derek Holmes was to my friend Anne at University, when he took her to bed at a party, and she said afterwards to me that he had hurt her: Part 1Counsellor And was she a virgin do you think? Peter Yes, I think she was. She said she had never had a boyfriend, and I had a crush on her because she had such lovely hair and wore that red dress that made het look like a post box from a distance… Counsellor And why do you think she told you this? Peter I don't know, I will never know, and of course I didn't know what to say to her. Even now, all these years later, I think of her and wish I could have done better. Counsellor Do you think you are trying to rescue women? Peter Yes, I think I am and I like to identify with Philip Marlowe who is always trying to rescue damsels in distress… Counsellor And do they always want to be rescued, Peter?. Peter No, I don't think they doPause Counsellor And do you know what happened to Anne? Peter Oh yes, she met someone the next year at University, called Ian, when I was living at The Rise in Mill Hill, and they were there one night and he showed me that poem by e. e. cummings, It may not always be so, and I thought he was telling me that I should give her up, and so I did. Counsellor You were still holding a candle for her then? Peter Yes, I suppose I was. Counsellor And what about Viv, where did she figure in all this? Peter Oh, she didn't know, because she was living in Bournemouth and would just come up at weekends. Counsellor You were having your cake and eating it then? Peter (smiling as he does in his photos) Yes, I suppose I was really. Part 2Counsellor Well, Pete, now we'll go on to more recent concerns. How do you feel about women now? Are you still trying to rescue and protect them? Peter it's a bit of yes and no really. There's Sue who I love, and I want to protect her from the bullying she has at work, but I'm not her Dad so I don't want to go too far. Counsellor You could just listen, don't make any judgements. Sometimes that's all any of us need, Pete. Peter OK I'll try. Counsellor (smiling) And stop watching all those television programmes. Yes, I know all about Rhys and about Everton, and about the parents' grief, but you don't want to be sad and angry all the time do you? Peter (suddenly shouting) No, of course I don't but it's just that I'm so fucking sick of the fucking world and fucking Trump, and that Rochdale thing about the 3 girls that's just been on, and about the fucking war in Syria, and about Grammar Schools and… Counsellor Hey come on, come on, Pete, it's okay. The world's not always such a bad place. Pete Now you sound like my mother. Counsellor Well, maybe she had a point. Peter Maybe she did. Could you give me a hug, please. Counsellor Of course. They stand and hold each other for a momentCounsellor Goodbye now, Pete. I'll see you next week. Peter Goodbye, Aiden. He leavesMelanie's Ruby Tuesday plays softly in the background. (Use version with her sitting on a beach with her guitar).

I think I have many and would like to explore them Thank you for sharing yours. Here goes When Viv left I was about to go on a school trip with my headmaster and a group of 20 children to the Yorkshire Dales. I still went and for two weeks carried out this highly sensitised existence, similar to how I am feeling now, where I knew somehow I would have to survive. I didn't want to die. I felt like it but I didn't want to. So I was in the Yorkshire Dales with 20 children and a colleague, and we were walking, and suddenly the heavens opened and it rained cats, dogs, goats, monkeys, giraffes, even elephants, and although it was June, it was cold. Now these children, twelve/thirteen, some of them didn't have the proper equipment, because kids are like that, and they were cold and wet and very scared. But the head, who was slapdash but also resourceful slit open two survival bags and fixed them against one of the dry stone walls like a sort of lean-to, and we got the children inside, and some of them were crying and very frightened, and I knew I had to protect them so I went into the mother role which I am quite good at because I had seen my own mother do it, and I enclosed them together insiide the lean-to, as I imagine a mother would, although I didn't think about it, it just happened. When I got home to an empty house I wrote this poem, or it wrote me. I didn't even think about it, it just came out. This is the aha moment. Stone WallsThe dry stone wallBuilt with such infiniteCare and patienceGave us shelterWhen we were rained on. Rock upon rockOur backs against themAnd the storm lethalAs we huddled togetherThere was warmth in the stones From the men who had laid themAll that strengthProtected usFrom the sharp weather. So will I with the same warm strengthCarefully rebuild the wallWhen they are gone. Stone upon stoneRock upon rockNo gaps, no cracksNo falling downThis time. July 1980And I didn't die, I carried on, like Linden says, or Bob Dylan or both, 'Keep on keeping on'. But there were some gaps still reader and if I haven't bored you too much with all this bleeding heart stuff, I will tell you about another one, which funnily enough was probably the worst but became the best. I hope that intrigues you because it is quite interesting really and I have already mentioned it when l told you about going to Ireland, which was the nice bit, not the hard bit. And, by the way reader your story was pretty good too and it helps me that you show me how we can say things to each other, deep things, that are hard to discuss in talking, especially for men, and I know you don't really mind about the 'bleeding heart stuff' but we have to defend ourselves us men because we are supposed to be hunter gatherers, and it doesn't look good to the other hunter gatherers if you can't keep up with the pack, unless you are Paul Gascoine, but that is just a joke, and I think you are telling me to get on with it. So now here it is, the hard bit, and, remember you have still got the journey to America to come, which I will read to you when I've got it from the loft in my head, if I can find it. We will have to see. Peter had met Barbara on a singles week in Yorkshire run by a brilliant woman called Sylvia Longstaff which he had read about in a women's magazine and for some reason Barbara had found him sexy. Well sod it, she ended it before he did, which he would have done anyway because no way was this woman right for him, she just found him sexy and he was flattered because no-one had ever said that before, and this sex thing is a scared place to be out in, it's a game and he hadn't learned how to play it yet, but he would. The American journey had helped, but now he was out there again, a bit recovered but not quite yet, he had to learn a few more things. And they taught him, the gods, or is it goddesses, and they were kind to him, and at least two goddesses just enjoyed his company for a bit without the sex thing getting in the way. And one day he said to her, one of the goddesses, (and I must tell you reader that she was pretty beautiful, and was from Ireland, and had been married and left and had two children, and had returned home from Belfast one day, unexpectedly to find her current boyfriend in bed with another woman, yes these things do happen reader as you probably know) who liked Van Morrison and smoked dope, and worked as a secretary in Peter's college and seemed like the perfect woman for him; but she knew differently, because goddesses for all their beauty are pretty canny, he said to her: 'Come to Ireland with me'and she said no, not because she didn't like him, but because she was fed up with men and needed time to recover from her 'hurt heart'. And he went to Ireland on his own, and I think I've already told you this, but I've now added some visuals about the journey to America and the journey to Ireland. End. A Sense of Freedom, reader, that's what I learned; to be free to be beautiful and romantic and loving, and not to be afraid to love those things that others laugh at, like being weak, or 'sensitive' as my mother used to say. You know I wrote a poem once called 'You're so fucking sensitive' because someon said that to me and I threw it back, and said, I will be sensitive if I want to be.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":16,"midCount":4,"highCount":8,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":216,"file":"peter responses/Day 7: Response","title":"Day 7: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-29 15:05:08","text":"Sue and I talk every day on the phone when she is at work at about one o'clock. I phone her mobile from the house phone and we talk for maybe 5 minutes. It is reassuring for her and for me because her job in a care home is hard. She started it a year ago, after being out of work for a couple of years. She is what is called an activities co-ordinator for people with dementia and often near the end of life. The care home is staffed by mainly working class women, many Phillipinos. I sense that many are tough, especially Julie, her boss, who is part of a management clique. Sue has never been part of anything like this before, although she did work in St Monica's, Winchester when she was a girl. She likes working with old people and is a good listener. She wanted to be a nurse but was not strong enough, she says, for the physical side of it. She became a secretary. When I met her she was working at Oxford University. Becky was at Christchurch, a strange co-incidence. Sue and I had met at a party and when I said, I won't see you again, she gave me her phone number. This was unusual. I still have it in my wallet where it has been for 20 years. I find using the phone difficult because my hearing is poor and I avoid it when I can. Hearing aids are okay, and help, especially the new digital ones, but I can't use mobiles. I have to lip read so phones are always difficult but generally the landline is better Email is a form of communicating I really love. It is about words rather than voices, although I do love to talk to people. It's funny. I had just started Bella Bathurst's book ‘Sound’ before I began this project. She lost her hearing when she was 27 and in the book she tells it exactly how it is to be in a silent world of your own. When I read the review of her book I recognised the stages of denial you go through over hearing loss and I emailed her to say I would be getting the book, and she replied… Communicating with others is vital for me. This i-pad is a fairly recent method of doing it. Bex gave it me as a present and I now use it a lot to check references and send emails. I use face-time every now and then to talk to my sister who is working in Cambodia. She is helping girls who have been trafficked to China and whose families have rejected them. Sometimes I talk to Becky and can see, my grandchildren, Alistair and Tamar. Actually this project, and using the Evernote with it, has opened up new ways of communicating for me. I love storytelling and last night I wrote a short play on the iPad to express things that had been crowding my mind the past, my Mum, femaleness in the form of a story. I don't really agree with what Rebecca Solnitt says about communication. I have lived alone, just waiting desperately for a phone call or a letter that never came. Now it is great that there are more channels to communicate with, even though it might just be with yourself. I once read Jimmy Boyle's book 'A Sense of Freedom' (1977) about the isolation he suffered in his solitary cell in Barlinnie Prison. Now Boyle had been a violent man but he found his truth in prison through writing. I wrote a poem for him about the violence of isolation: '… a little space of cleared floor/where they could not touch you/where the batons hammered uselessly/against your skull. ' He never allowed his dignity to be taken away. So I'm saying that all forms of digital communication can be good emails, texting, FaceTime, Facebook. It is a matter of how you choose to use it and, as we use it more, conventions appear, to ease the process of these new ways of sharing each other's words and thoughts. Virtual relationships can never match the importance of real ones, simply because there is no touch or closeness of bodies and voices. Just the presence of another person in a room is enough to transform the space you both occupy. Sometimes we need and seek solitude, at other times we need the 'otherness' of a person. There can be nothing more lonely than relating to a virtual person, a blow-up doll… As I wake up an example of virtual communication appears to me. It is the last episode tonight of Little Boy Blue, about the shooting of Rhys Jones, which had all the elements Liverpudlian (which I am), supporter of Everton (which I have been for 60+ years), the incredible bravery of a mother in carrying on (which I have already mentioned). For the first episode I posted on Facebook to ask my friends should I watch it and there were three responses from my daughter, Becky, from Jackie, an ex-teaching colleague, and from my sister-in-law, Sue. I had recorded the episode and posted a review which praised the skill of the writer. This is an approximation of the posts: Peter I don't know whether to watch this or not, can my Facebook friends help? Bex Don't watch it Daddy. You know how it will make you feel. Jackie (mother of two boys and a rebel in every aspect of her life) Yes, you should watch it. Sue Vicarious, emotional porn. I'm Liverpudlian but I won't go near it. Peter I hear-what you're saying. But I remember at school the gangs. I was 12, and Palmer showed me a clock pendulum that could be held in a weighted fist, and a sharpened belt, to be used in a fight. How far is this from a knife or a gun? We must look after our boys. Pause as Peter leaves FacebookPeter (returning to Facebook later) Well, I watched it as you knew I would and yes, it was harrowing. No further posts I chose to be harrowed didn't I because I think I wanted to share the pain of Rhys's parents, the pain sometimes of being human. I think now of The Pieta, which Lara showed us at the Aarhus conference as part of her and Linden's presentation. 'Art is the nearest thing to life… ' George Eliot 1856) If the drama can help Rhys's mother and father deal with their grief about the death of their son by sharing their pain with others, then yes it should be out there and I can watch it, just as I have looked at The Pieta in Rome and thought with Keats, who died there on the Spanish Steps, that to be alive is often 'to be full of sorrow/And leaden eyed despairs… 'The Pieta'","mood":"lowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":12,"midCount":10,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":217,"file":"peter responses/Day 2.

I never built tree houses or liked sheds and feel better in open rather than closed spaces. I always admire people who can build their own houses like my son-in-law, Dan, or my hippy friends, but have no desire to do this myself. And yet I love stories about people surviving, using their basic skills, like Robinson Crusoe, say, or Admiral Byrd in the Antarctic wastes.

It is such a strong image, Icarus flying and the going too near the sun and crashing broken to the ground. He didn't listen to his father. I had no father to listen to, only a mother who frantically repaired her nest, when he was no longer there to do so, her broken man who was not there to feed his chicks.

A Liverpudlian's Taleit is 1997. The scene is Stantonbury Campus in Milton Keynes. Chris and Pete are just entering the turnstile and going through to pay their money for swimming. This is something they have been doing now for 13 years, since meeting as teachers at a middle school in 1984, when Pete was very single and Chris was married to Sue. Chris and Sue had just come back from living in Japan, where they had taught English to Japanese students. They were a very gregarious couple and had invited Pete into their life and world, where there were lots of family and friends. Very early in their friendship they had taken him to the newly opened Japanese restaurant in Milton Keynes town centre, and then, on another day, to the Peace Pagoda by Willen Lake. Pete and Chris really did get on well together in a male bonding way, and they started going to the pool every Thursday morning, before work, and every Monday evening after it. They often joked with each other in the pool about meeting two nurses and going away with them for an exciting weekend, and, even though Chris was happily married and had two children, Emily and Sam, and Pete was eventually also happily married to Sue, they still continued their joke. Now you know about Pete, reader, but not yet about Chris, so I will tell you. Chris was from working class stock, his Dad a factory foreman in Luton and his mum, a teacher, and then a headteacher. Chris had grown up in Luton and, being small there, had had to look after himself, not with his fists, but with words. Chris could devastate anyone within a five mile radius with a few choice witticisms aimed at the jugular. People did not get on the wrong side of Chris and come away smiling. Now I am going to take the role of the omniscient narrator, reader, and i am going to get on the inside of Chris and let him tell Pete's story, the story Pete tries to avoid telling; and so Chris will tell the story which Pete cannot, has never really been able to tell because it is so close to him; yes, now Chris, his friend, will tell it. I met Pete in 1984. I was starting a supply teaching job in Woburn Sands. Sue and I had had to come back from Japan rather suddenly, because my Mum had been diagnosed with a brain tumour. It wasn't terminal, however, and settled down, and then Sue and I also settled down near to Mum in Newport Pagnell. 'Teaching was a piece of piss for me. I could literally do it standing on my head and almost without looking. I got the job at Fulbrook, teaching English and other subjects and there was a staff meeting the first day for the beginning of term. I was sitting next to a bloke called Pete, gentle enough, if a bit edgy, and we introduced ourselves to each other. 'As the week went on we exchanged a few words and got talking. It appeared he too was new to the school. He had moved from Sandy to Cranfield in the summer and was starting a job there at Fulbrook Middle as Head of Science. Pete would later tell me that he hadn't even got a Science O'level, but had retrained as a Science teacher in 1981 at Bedford College under the auspices of a 'can doo' lecturer named Anne Pennell. Anne, I knew as I made it my business to know, had been the prime mover behind the success of Primary Science in the Home Counties. 'Anyway, never mind that. Pete would later tell me in one of our chats, either while swimming or in the pub, that for his degree he had to memorise 2, 000 lines of Beowulf. I thought that was a pretty impressive feat for a Scouser and I told him so. ' But there was a lot of other stuff that was interesting about Pete. Two weeks after the term had started he asked if I would like to go for a drink with him. I said I would and we went to the Nags Head in Great Linford and we shared our stories, me that l was born and brought up in Luton, and had trained as a teacher in Exeter where I had met Sue, a journalist who was from Cornwall, and had courted her and lived in Brixton with her, and married her and then travelled to Japan, where we spent a fantastic 3 years before returning home because of Mum. 'But Pete's story was more eventful than mine. He was born and brought up in Liverpool, he told me, as we sat drinking together, and his Dad had died when he was twelve, and he had grown up fatherless with his brother and sister, and of course his Mum whom he told me was indomitable. 'I was immediately sympathetic, being very close to my own father, who was soft and kind, a perfect foil for my Mum, and who had shown me all the intricacies of how car engines worked and of how to decorate a room, and how to make a lawn from turves of grass. Pete gave me to understand that he had never had any of that, and that he had only learned to drive a year ago. To put it simply, I was surprised at that, but he told me he had ridden a motorbike instead. Apparently you can't use that licence to drive a car. The skills are different. 'Whatever, I was even more surprised when he began telling me of the events of his life during the past four years. He had been, as he thought, happily married with a gorgeous daughter and living in Sandy, Bedfordshire, but that things had been difficult for him for some time. He had had a minor breakdown while working at Sandy Upper School because, suddenly, he just couldn't deal with the more than unusually difficult classes that he had been given at the school, and one day he just couldn't go in to work. 'And his wife, who had watched while her husband undertook the highly stressful job of teaching and realised that he would never be a headteacher, called the doctor who pronounced burnout due to the highly stressful job of teaching and signed him off work for three weeks. 'Pete told me, he had lain there in bed for the three weeks, reading among other things, The Raj Quartet by Paul Scott while his wife tended the house and looked after their child, and watched while her husband slowly got better, and wondered whether it was this that she had signed up for when she had married him, she who was pretty, and who had once been photographed for the Bournemouth Echo in a mini-skirt with a policeman. Yes, she wondered. 'And she wondered. 'But, Pete told me, he had got better, and had decided that teaching wasn't for him, and had resigned and taken a job as the clerk of Sandy Town Council, but had found that that wasn't really for him either, because one Friday two of the councillors had come to see him after work, suddenly and angrily, and had told him they were not satisfied with his work, no longer required his services, and were giving him a week's notice, and that he could leave immediately. (There was a lot of politics behind this, reader, which Pete wasn't used to, and he had tried to be neutral as the town clerk, not taking sides, which he thought was the right way, but, no, he should have taken sides with the two that had come to see him that Friday night. But he didn't, so they got rid of him, because they were powerful men, even though they did live in a small town called Sandy, Bedfordshire, where a lot of brussell sprouts were grown. If you want to laugh now you can, reader, but then we must proceed with the story.)'And so he left the town council offices, Pete told me, he left, and he had no job, and he had a wife, and a child, a beautiful child, that he had watched grow up and had bathed, and changed, and had read to each night. And he had got the sack, for no real reason other than that his face didn't fit. (Let's just pause a moment reader, because what you are about to hear next is quite heart-rending. I am the omniscient narrator and will appear when you see brackets, but we now have Chris, the friend that Pete has made at Fulbrook Middle School, and he is about to tell you the saddest part of Pete's story.) Pete was there in Sandy with no job and with a wife and child, and a mortgage to pay, when the headmaster of the local middle school, who had read about the sacking because it was in the local papers, rang him up and said that he was a teacher short because one of his colleagues had died suddenly from a heart attack, and would Pete like to take over the class that had suddenly been left without anyone to teach them? 'And Pete, told me, his new friend Chris, that he had said yes, yes, of course he would, and started at the school the next week and wholeheartedly embraced the lifebelt he had been thrown by Mr Donnison, the headmaster, and worked and worked at the new job, and made some mistakes, he told me, because who doesn't? but was eventually given a full contract by Mr Donnison, who had read about his sacking in the newspaper and who had offered the life-line. (But dark forces were gathering for Pete, reader, and Chris could see before he said it, what he was going to tell him, so I will let him do the telling because he was a good friend of Pete and will tell it properly. What did he tell you Chris, what was it?)'What did he tell me? Well, what he told me was that his pretty wife had met a man in Sandy who was not a bit like Pete, but was confident and well-groomed, and very financially secure, which Pete wasn't, although he did have a job, and the wife had been spending time with this man, unbeknown to Pete, and had been away with him when Pete thought she was at her mother's, and Pete had never really thought that such a thing was possible, had thought that it was the stuff of soap operas, and anyway he liked looking after Becky, his daughter, whenever his wife was away. 'But, it wasn't just the stuff of soap, operas, it was real life, it was real, nasty, gritty life, and so Pete told me, his new friend Chris, that they were one day in Bournemouth to see his father-in-law, who patently had never really liked Pete and had called him John or Dave or anything other than who he was. 'Anyway, on that one day, Pete told me, his wife, who was the driver, Pete didn't, had suddenly pulled the car over to the side of the road and burst into tears and told him between sobs that she was having an affair, and that she was in love, and that there was nothing Pete could do about it because she was leaving and taking their daughter with her, and that she was going to live with the man with whom she was having the affair. (They had worked it all out, reader.)' Pete told me, his new friend, Chris, that he had gone into a state of shock there in the car, but that there was nothing he could do. Just like there was nothing his Dad could do about the illness that had killed him, there was nothing Pete could do about the woman, his wife, who no longer wanted him, so he had got out of the car and walked away. Well, was it a soap opera reader? you tell me, because now I am no longer Chris, Pete's friend, no I am not he, no I am now the omniscient narrator, without the brackets, like George Eliot, who loved even her least likeable characters, such as Rosamond Vincey and Mr Bulstrode, I am the author, the writer, the singer, the teller of stories, the seafarer, the wayfarer, the shape shifter, the creator, the dancer, the healer the restorer, the life-giver, because you know reader that in spite of all that had happened to him, Pete did not die, no he did not. No, he got better, and better, much better. And I have told you this, his story because I loved him, and there is a flawed cracked Japanese bowl in our picture today and the flaw has been mended without disguising the original crack, and I think this is true, reader, of many of our lives, it is certainly true of Pete's. EndThat cracked Japanese bowl is an incredible symbol, Alice. A bit more of your magic.

It was she who got me reading and through this I could become anyone I wanted. Mum was a great fan of Anne of reen Gables, being a bit of a tomboy herself, and from Anne I graduated to What Katy Did by Susan Coolidge and because I had found her myself I loved Katy more. Katy was an adventurous girl, always dreaming of rescuing people and I wanted to do this with her. When she fell from the swing which she had been forbidden by her Aunt Izzy I was devastated. For weeks she lay as her injured spine corrected itself and the message was that Katy was being brave. I realise now that I must have absorbed this message about femininity, that being a girl and then a woman was that you had to be brave, you had to cope. This of course was reinforced as I watched my mother coping with Dad's multiple sclerosis. She watched the man she had married for security and who had created three children with her dying before her eyes. She had to be brave did Mum. It was a lesson I learned too. When Viv had left I said to Becky we have to be brave. I really meant I did, not her, for she was going with Viv to a new life. I had to cope without them. She was four. Another traditionally feminine side is vulnerability, although men feel it too and boy did it happen to me. But I just had to keep on being brave, going to work and coming home. It was like being an actor, performing and then collapsing backstage. Men need to hide that vulnerability from the world. The feminine side wants to weep, and writing and performing poetry helped me do that acceptable weeping. But to return to my theory of reading, inspired by Mum, great writers can make us live in their characters and become them. I am thinking particularly of George Eliot and Middlemarch where I became both Lydgate and Dorothea, the two idealists. Lydgate betraying himself because he wanted a pretty wife, and Dorothea, oh what a story. I was with Dorothea as she married Casaubon because she looked up to him and his great learning. And then she found it was nothing and the terrible realisation coming to her in Rome on her honeymoon that her marriage was a dreadful mistake. But she was lucky he died and she was free to marry Will, although if Eliot had dared she could have just let Dorothea be free. Art can transform us (men), it can help us reach our feminine side. I always think that if Raoul Moat had been able to appreciate poetry he would not have shot his girlfriend, killed her lover and also a policeman and then himself. I would have shown him, It may not always be so, where cummings speaks of renunciation. If she doesn't want you let her go… 'Then shall i turn my face, and hear one bird/sing terribly afar in the lost lands. 'Ha, I have woken up thinking about my feminine qualities. Looking after a baby, that must be one surely? So I watched my mother bringing my sister into the world while all around her was crumbling, and here was an example of nurturing that I learned, so when Bex was born it was easy for me to nurture her, to give her that five o' clock in the morning bottle feed, to bath her and to read to her each night. And of course changing her and washing her nappies with Viv how could I forget the bucket under the sink (no wonder she left canned laughter) and those billowing sails on the line? And now I see Dan doing it all with Bex's children. So does the masculine become feminine? Looking again at the notes, What is my truth? I thought it was this once but maybe it was my lie… More, more, more… Well it is good to have this rest. I have now been able to read about Cixous and escriture feminine which was suggested to me when I was researching for my paper at Aarhus, but my tutor, Wilma, thought it was too involved for me to get into: 'The female writer is seen as suffering the handicap of having to use a medium (prose writing) which is essentially a male instrument fashioned for male purposes. ' One might imagine this statement could provoke lively discussion. The piece then goes on to say that e f can be employed by male authors such as Joyce. I expect she is thinking of Molly Bloom's soliloquy in Ulysses. '. and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes. ' A few literary examples are given at the end but nothing on Pat Barker. For a prose account of female suffering I would recommend Union Street (1982) a fictional account of male physical and sexual violence towards women in the North East. Great writers can put you there, you are the characters, and Barker does this. The book was recommended to me by a student when we were reading The Ghost Road. A memory of domestic violenceThe scene is the dining room. They are sitting either side of the fireplace. There is a pot of tea on the small table between them.

Later, returning to Liverpool, and Roz was doing her own thing, Shirl got to Milan Station. She had missed her train and the station was closing at midnight. A guard offered her a bed in his office nearby. Shirl trusted him and spent the night there. She awoke at 6am and everything was okay. She was 23. I have helped her today by listening. Like me she suffers from chronic anxiety, learned from our Mum, I think. My brother doesn't suffer from it, but he doesn't have strawberry blonde hair, nor incidentally did Mum or Dad. Was it a fault in the genes, not in the stars, I think that Mendel, monk, had something to do with discovering this. Shirl is a committed Christian but doesn't throw it in your face. She is married and has two lovely children who were educated largely in Cambodia. She went to Cambodia, after Mum had died, freeing her from the inevitable only daughter responsibility. She was about 33 and had finally moved away from Mum to live independently, and be a warden at a Liverpool University hostel. She had got an English Lit degree from there. WhenMum then died she was free to live her dream and go to help people in Cambodia to develop themselves after the genocide there. Today I listened to her and, while her anxiety did not disappear, it was lessened. Listened -Lessened. She told me today that she was looking for 'a pearl of great price. ' We discussed this but she couldn't really define what it meant to her. She knows it from the bible but I know it from Shakespeare's Othello about Desdemona who was murdered for her supposed infidelity.

Peter (Cheerfully) HelloAndrew, (the man with the beard) sits very still saying nothing. After a moment Peter sits down in a chair feeling nonplussed. A moment later two other people, a man and a woman come in and sit on other chairs. Two more women come in and sit down near each other, both are smartly dressed. The woman who came in with the man is in her twenties and is called Sara. Voice: Yalom says that patients will begin to display their maladaptive interpersonal behaviour in the group; there is no need to describe their pathology: they will sooner or later act it out before the group members own eyes. Peter (brightly) This is my first time here. I'm PeterAn Indian woman in a sari now comes in and sits on the other chair in the centre. A man with glasses follows her and sits in one of the other chairs in the circle. John sorry I'm late. It's the traffic. Peter (eagerly) Yes, I know Bedford's always bad at this time. I had to… Sara (cutting him off) I always think of the stables and the land. It was going to be mine. Cynthis (one of the two women who came in together) You always say that, Sara, Didn't you know what was going to happen? Sara looks annoyed but remains silent. The silence continues. Peter, to the group. I'm new. Can you tell me what happens here? Sara, (ignoring him) The land it was mine and the horses. Peter (trying again) What are your names? I'm PeterCarol, I'm CarolMan with glasses, I'm David, (gesturing to the two chairs) They never say anything, they just listen, Peter, Oh, I see. One of the smartly dressed women, (trying to fill the silence) Like I said, I'm Carol. I work st the collegePeter, Oh yes I know it. I did a course there once. (He focuses on her) Why are you here then? Carol, oh I've had problems at work and in my relationship What about you? Peter, Oh yes, I've had relationship problems too. I got divorced about twelve years ago and can't seem to get married again. I've had a few girlfriends, though, chuckling to himself as if he is a man of the world. Sara, So you got divorced, well that happens to a lot of peoplePeter, Yes I know but… Sara, Some of you men are pathetic, always moaning about being hurtSylvia (who has not spoken yet), oh leave him alone, Sara, he's new here. Peter, (reassuring himself) Yes, I'll have to… Sara (withdraws into herself) I just remember about the land, that's allPeter, (trying to be helpful) What happened about the land then, Sara? Can you tell us? Sara. (looking angry at this suggestion of intimacy) No I don't want to tell you, and they've heard it all before anyway. (she is becoming tearfu)First man, to the Indian woman, 'Why don't you say something if he won't? ' (nodding towards Andrew)The psychotherapists sit silently, moving only slightly to shift their weight. Voice: Yalom says on page 96 that they learned also that though one could be close to others there was nonetheless a point beyond which one could not be accompanied: there is a basic aloneness to existence that must be faced and cannot be avoided. Peter, Get better. I will get better. First Man, I'm happily married. I just can't seem to see the point of things and no- one seems able to help me, no-one, not these two (indicating the psychotherapists), not anyone. Peter, But we can, isn't that the point. We can help each other, isn't that why we're here? No-one says anything. They all sit in silence for about ten minutes. Finally The Indian woman announces that the session is at an end. They get up and put the chairs to the sides of the room, some of them say a few words to each other. Peter goes as if to talk to Carol and then decides not to. Gradually all go out through the door singly. But if you smile at me, you know I will understand, plays softly in the background as the session comes to an end. Scene 2Peter has been going to the group now for two years. He has got used to going on a Monday, coming home, getting supper, watching something like Brushstrokes on T. V. And then going swimming at Stantonbury Campus with his best friend Chris. They have now been doing this for 12 years and, although they talk a lot to each other as they swim up and down the pool about the week's events, Peter has said very little about the psychotherapy sessions. After a session he talks to Andrew about leaving the group. Andrew, There is a way of leaving groups. I'd like you to come for two or three more sessions and tell them you want to leave. Peter, Yes, Sara left abruptly didn't she? Andrew, Sara had many problems. You have started to solve yours. After you leave, in about six months time I'll write to you inviting you to come back here and talk to me, to see how you are. Peter, Oh the good old NHS! (Laughing)Andrew (smiles) Yes, good bye now. We'll see you next week and you can start leaving. Voice: Yalom says that termination is, after all, a part of every relationship, and throughout one's life one must on many occasions, say goodbye to important people. The scene ends and Peter goes out of the building, accompanied by the song, Because of You, sung by Dexy's Midnight Runners, the theme tune of Brushsrokes. End4. 25 Today we are going to Paul and Sue, my brother for a break. They live in Hunmanby, North Yorkshire. When we were little Mum and Dad used to bring us to Filey, near Hunmsanby for walking holidays. We stayed at a house on the front with other families. A 'host' would be elected both to lead the walks and organise social events at the house. One day near the end of one of the walks Dad started stumbling and falling down. Two men from the group got either side of him and he put his arms over their shoulders. They helped him walk back to the house. It was about a mile. I now know that this was the beginning of his multiple sclerosis.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":16,"midCount":6,"highCount":9,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":222,"file":"peter noticings/Day 13: Noticings..","title":"Day 13: Noticings…","created_date":"2018-02-03 14:22:57","text":"I knew somehow I would have to survive.

Sylvia Longstaff ran Longstaff Leisure from a beautiful house in Buckden in the Yorkshire Dales, near Kettlewell, one of my favourite places. Although it was run for singles, her primary aim was not to match people up, nor could it be, for the ratio of men to women, and I am not ignoring gay people here it just wasn't an issue, was about 6 14 (roughly 20 in all from what I can remember.)So when I stupidly said to one of the women that it was 'like being in a sweetshop' I was roundly condemned by her and was probably lucky not to get 'a punch in the gob' as we say in Liverpool. But she let me off because most women, I think, are kind, but after all she had paid the same money as me and it wasn't fair really. Unless actually you were looking for something else, which I wasn't, but still didn't know I wasn't, still wanted that elusive feminine embrace. Sylvia was good with people who were looking for something else and did dance and movement classes with us and took us for walks, and for swimming together in the local pool (with jacuzzi) and told us about Feel the Fear… by Susan Jeffers, and invited a woman to talk to us about clothes/colour matching, and had a Christmas Morning where we all came down in our dressing gowns and opened presents from home. And where Pete and Pete (who had a Lamborghini) pretended to be Italian waiters and romanced the women, Pete, the one without the Lamborghini, and wearing a natty waistcoat, romancing Ramona, yes Romancing Ramona who was from South America, that sounds good doesn't it reader? And they became friends, not lovers, no lovers was for Pete with The Lamborghini who romanced Jill, and took her away in The Lamborghini at the end of the holiday to somewhere where they probably had great sex, and maybe are having great sex even now, I don't know. And am I being ironic reader? Yes, I am. The Pete without the Lamborghini couldn't get enough of Longstaff Leisure and Sylvia knew it and said, 'It is working for you isn't it? ' and Pete WTL said yes and came again for a third visit and met Barbara, but you already know the result of that one, don't you reader? Yes, there he got the metaphorical punch in the gob from Barbara, whether he deserved it or not I just don't know, but any way the gods forgave him for upsetting the goddesses as I will tell you: On his fourth visit to Longstaff Leisure Pete went cautiously and danced pleasantly with Ann, who told him she had met someone through a group called Nexus, and that they were going to be married but she had already booked this holiday so had come anyway… And so Pete, who was by now becoming a bit more canny in these matters of the single life, when he got home found out about his local Nexus and joined it and started going to Nexus parties. Which is where, after about a year, he met Sue. Bottle of wine please for Ann, or perhaps two bottles or even three, and if we want to become metaphysical, reader, let's give her an ocean of wine for telling Pete about Nexus, yes an ocean.. 'A flask of wine, a book of verse and thou'And Sue as you sit beside me wearing your jade earings and looking at me with your loveliness, I am so grateful to Ann, and Sylvia, and Pete, and Ramona, and Barbara, and even The Lamborghini for leading me to you.

Response to FACT I have really felt the longing to be a published writer of anything: stories, articles, poems, novels, plays, autobiographies, biographies.

Often you stopped, with your little fingersGathered the tiniest wild white flowers, And reached up insistently to press them In my pocket. I found a clump of linden, Showing you the seeds' small parachutes; Those that the wind would blow down from the trees, That might be blown from our hands if we breathed. 25/09/1980She is wondering about marriage, will she ever make a successful one and how can she keep a record of her life that will help her make sense of it? She has just produced a beautiful book of photographs for her Dad about him and her, and Sue and Dan and her children, for his birthday. She has made a lovely marriage that works and has just held a party for 23 children at her new/old house in Farnham. She had lived in China and Malaysia for ten years with Dan, having Alastair 5 years ago and Tamar one year ago. She is nearly 41 years old, next month. She went to Christchurch college in Oxford where she did s psychology degree. She worked in Human Resources for Shell but now just wants to be a mother. Her mother, Vivien Rothwell, then Leyland, then Monaghan, now Dicks, is sometimes Keera Highes. She left Becky's stepfather, Peter Monsghsn, (whose name, reader I can still hardly say, and who I wanted to murder, yes murder, like Othello wanted to murder Cassio because he mistakenly thought Cassio was fucking his wife, and reader I am sorry to use that word, but we do use it when we are angry) she Vivien who left Peter Leyland and who had left Peter Monaghan ten years ago for Alan and married him. He is/was also an accountant and Peter Leyland gets on with him because he is 'Blokey''. He and Viv/Keira moved to Minehead in Somerset to be near Dan's parents. Becky loves Dan's Mum and likes to stay there. Viv/Keera Highes was 15 when Peter met her on a beach in St Ives, Cornwall. She lived with her Dad, Alan, in Bournemouth. He was an alcoholic. Viv/Keira Highes's Mum, who had had an illegitimate baby, June, when she was 16, and who worked in a mill in Oldham, had met Alan, who had rescued her with the baby. He had married her but when Viv came along he sent June to live with her grandma, Viv's Mum was also called Marjorie, but there the similarity ends, because this Marjorie had never been a tomboy like my Mum but was working class and was warm and loved easily, perhaps once too easily, because she had had June, the illegitimate baby. But she had moved with Alan to Bournemouth because it was 'posher' for want of a better word, than Oldham. And when Peter met Viv she lived with Alan in Bournemouth, who now had custody of her, because her Mum had left him for Pat, a Greek Waiter, because Alan was violent in his alcoholism to her and Marjorie was soft and warm and wanted to be loved so she left Alan and she left Viv. (Poor Viv, reader, yes I am beginning to understand her). And so there was Alan and Viv, and there was me, and she could escape from Bournemouth to Finchley with me and tell her friends that she was seeing a man in London. She was 16, still wearing her beret, not very old, but she was sexy, and he liked that and he was lost in her, utterly lost. 'Nothing else is' in John Donne's words and he was studying English Literature in London so what can you expect? Sex, yes, there was lots of that, because he was 19 and, well, when you're 19 and a man you can't think about much else, honestly reader, you can't, except your books and your poetry. So she lived with him for six months in Finchley and neither of them could deal with that really, especially when the man of the couple they lived with touched her knee under the table and the wife noticed and brought down the roof on them, and Peter heard Neave saying, 'I'm sorry, Sandy, ' in the bedroom next door to theirs and crying, and Peter thought 'Oh my God, what have I done. ' You know reader he was beginning to realise that this sex thing might be a bit double edged, but let's not laugh at him too hard, reader, for he did suffer for it in the end, yes he did, suffer, he really did, but let's move on… Eventually Viv went back to Bournemouth, not to her Dad but her Mum, and he, Peter, went back to Liverpool for the summer holidays, and his brother, Paul, came to Finchley to help him move from where the two edges of sex had met so sharply, and bring him home. And his Mum didn't know anything about the living together because how could he have told her that, he who usually told her everything, because he liked talking, reader, Peter, especially to his Mum, but he couldn't tell her about this, this sex thing that was gripping him, couldn't tell her. And his Mum knew something about the sex thing because she had had three children but she knew it was dangerous, And Peter's Mum had met Vivien and she was scared, because as I have said Vivien was sexy., for want of a better word. She was like the girls Malc and Peter had kissed in the shelters, but couldn't tell their mums about, although they usually told them everything; but Vivien was more so, much much more. And Peter's Mum, Marjorie (Billy) Leyland nee Baker, who had been a tomboy and who was good at netball, and whose husband, Frank, had died of an awful disease when he was 44, and who had had to care for him, and wash him and and change him and dress him, and bury him, had seen this girl, sixteen and sexy. and I mean very sexy, because she was, take her son away from her, the son, her first born, whom she loved, and as I say, she had seen this sexy girl take him away from her with her sex, marry him with her sex, have a baby with her sex, then eventually leave him with her sex. And so she said to her son, Peter, 'I told you so. ' Because mothers are wise. But she couldn't help Peter, hold him, embrace him, because she didn't know how. But his sister could who later, when their Mum died and she was free of her, would go to work in Cambodia at the age of 33, helping trafficked girls rejoin their families, and at 22 she came down to Bedford, to the marital home where Peter still lived in his brokenness, and embraced him and probably saved him from driving his motorbike at 60mph into a brick wall. But that is another story, reader, and very painful, so I won't tell it now, not yet, might not even have to tell it ever, because I think you may be beginning to understand now. And, anyway, I have to get up and start the day. 'I was born in Liverpool, or haven't you heard? I was the eldest son of me dad and this bird. I was brought up nice, when I was elevenI was sent to the same school as John Lennon' had been to, well Paul McCartney actually but that doesn't rhyme. And I made them laugh with that poem too at the workshop in 1981, and with those first two lines from the poem, just those, I started my paper at Aarhus this year, and they laughed there too as they had at the workshop in Bedford but this time it gave me a good feeling, a better feeling in fact because I had by now become myself. And if that doesn't make sense just yet you will have to read more because it will, I promise you, it will. (And that's why I have joined your Project, Alice because I wanted to check that I had really understood who I am, and I feel that my writing has never reached the creative level it is reaching now.) I will trust your judgement. Oh stop me before I go to the loft and find the other poem about schoolgirls (Aaaargghhh, save me from any misunderstanding. I was 14 for God's sake and they seemed to be everywhere on the street, on the bus, on the lawns of Aigburth Vale School which I passed each day on the same bus, the 86, and looked at from the windows, yes everywhere.) And now invading my class, learning Russian with Mr. Simmonds, were five Sixth form girls from Blackburne House, our sister school, and they had on little short gowns with green tassels because they were prefects, and they had come to us because Mr Simmonds, young and dark with a faint stubble, was teaching us O'level Russian, and they wanted to learn that too . from Mr Simmonds. Lucky Mr Simmonds. In front of him he had five seventeen year old girls with rounded hips and stockinged legs, and, if he wanted to impose order on the recalcitrant mob behind those girls, all he had to do was stride forward between the desks and bang their heads together, (and I can still remember reader mine being banged hard against Harco's, next to me, because we weren't listening.) But who could possibly listen when all you could do was look at the hips and legs of those sixth form girls and wonder, 'Why do I feel like this? ' And shuffle in your chair slightly to get more comfortable. Please laugh reader because it is like that, honest. Yes, my editor, some of it should be buried in the past, the motorbike and near death experience. Excise the triptych. Of motorbike and Wishpoem, and an itinerary of poems to read, because something else beckons me but what? What about thie diamond/womb shaped poem, Liverpool 8. Which was published in the school magazine, and later, Honesty, my friend Sue (Now Poole) telling me sbout it. It was inspired by Vision and Prayer that you like and I want to please you, Alice, I tend to do this. And I will look too at the Bjork video and see if that gives me any ideas. InterruptionReader I don't understand. It ts 1. 30am and I have had a dreadful row with my brother, Paul, because he intimated that I was weak with Becky and that I needed to control her and demand more time with my grandchildren and I wouldn't accept that. I accept that Becky had no choice but to go with Viv and not me during the divorce, I just had to let go reader, let go of the beautiful child I had helped to create, the child of Vivien and I. And Paul said I was weak and was always asking for help from people, giving the impression that l can't cope, demanding attention. And he is so right reader, I demand attention, but if I'm refused it or it is given to someone else, a love rival perhaps then I react and sometimes write a poem, or sometimes fall into a depression so severe that I thought it would never stop, and I did once want to be sectioned reader and put in hospital because I couldn't help myself, but the good doctor, Richard Perl, a kind man who had seen a lot of psychiatric patients suffer worse than me said to me that women have a worse time of it than men in his experience, yes Richard Perl, seeing that I wasn't learning and still getting hurt by women rejecting me, sent me to Andrew in Bedford for group therapy and it worked reader, it really did. I have tried to explain in a short play I wrote called The Learning Curve which is printed above. And the argument with Paul did not destroy us but in fact made us stronger. Paul's wife, Sue, cried and put her arms around me and held me, my wife, Sue, wanted to get in the car and go home but didn't say so. The two Sue's. And in the morning Paul brought out some old vinyl records of his that he knew I liked as a peace offering. And my Sue just watched this family that she had joined twenty years ago, gradually pull itself together, and heal itself because it was actually stronger than it knew it was. And the next day they all walked on Bempton Cliffs near Filey and Peter thought that he had never, ever felt so happy. Strange thing life, isn't it reader? Strange thing. But we love it. Love life, lovelife, how's yours? Oh, pretty good now actually.

Broadhurst states, Liminality is used to ‘describe a certain marginalised space which holds a possibility of potential forms, structures, conjectures and desire,’ within a performative space, and, ‘liminal performance can be described as being located at the edge of what is possible’ (1999: 12). Turner states, ‘liminality can perhaps be described as a fractile chaos, a fertile nothingness, a storehouse of possibilities, not by any means a random assemblage but a striving after new forms and structure’ (1988: 12).

I wake up and somehow I am singing: 'You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant. 'It is good to visit the dying. My Dad was in hospital, Stanley Park, Liverpool, suffering kidney failure from the multiple sclerosis that had afflicted him for eight years. Mum took me to the hospital to visit him. I took with me a stool I had made in the woodwork class with Mr MacDonald. And I think Dad smiled as he looked at my stool, but his mouth, which had once held a pipe filled with St Bruno flake, was now slack. Mum asked us how we would feel if God took Dad away from us? The next day Mum told us that Dad had died in the night. We didn't go to the funeral, but I remember people in black in the front room eating cake and drinking sherry. I suspect that at some point Mum told us that we must be brave, the same words I had said to Becky when I really meant I had to be brave, not her. In September 1962 I struggled up the road to the bus and never said anything to anybody about what had had happened to Dad. Except once. At the front of an Atlantean bus, looking out of the front window, Graham Blackburn (Blackie) suddenly asked me what my Dad did, and I said, 'He's dead’. Dave Smith, whose mother had four children, three of whom were younger and girls, also had a heart attack and died. And another caterpillar went into it’s chrysalis and another flying creature emerged from the soup, but this time not a butterfly. This time a moth. But still quite beautiful even though Peter's Mum hated them, hated their large soft bodies that had emerged from the primal soup, just like Peter had emerged from her as a boy and she didn't understand boys.

It was she who got me reading and through this I could become anyone I wanted. I realise now that I must have absorbed this message about femininity, that being a girl and then a woman was that you had to be brave, you had to cope. She had to be brave did Mum. When Viv had left I said to Becky we have to be brave. I really meant I did, not her, for she was going with Viv to a new life. I had to cope without them. She was four. Another traditionally feminine side is vulnerability, although men feel it too and boy did it happen to me. But I just had to keep on being brave, going to work and coming home. It was like being an actor, performing and then collapsing backstage. So Brave and so Hard. The feminine side wants to weep, and writing and performing poetry helped me do that acceptable weeping. Great writers can make us live in their characters and become them. ‘Living within another charged’ (Ettinger) Performative, embodied. ‘Trying on’ Internalising others states. Host mother.

Along with the poem form from Day 5… I can’t wait to read your story for Day 8 – I can see your feminine and masculine interplay and flow in the words from your hand… J Hope you liked the Day 8 story.

I played it to this class of what would now be Year 9s and they had given me a God awful time reading The Children's Bible, but when they had done their Intermediate exams based on this book I was free to ditch The Children's Bible and teach what I wanted which was about racism in the USA and South Africa, and some of them, notably Hadi, but maybe others too, changed their thinking like I had done.","mood":"lowlowlowlowmidmidhigh","lowCount":11,"midCount":3,"highCount":3,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":234,"file":"peter noticings/Day 4: Individual Noticings","title":"Day 4: Individual Noticings.","created_date":"2018-02-03 10:15:44","text":"Peter: A original reading by the poet I think Peter?

I phone her mobile from the house phone and we talk for maybe 5 minutes. I find using the phone difficult because my hearing is poor and I avoid it when I can. Hearing aids are okay, and help, especially the new digital ones, but I can't use mobiles. I have to lip read so phones are always difficult but generally the landline is better Email is a form of communicating I really love. It is about words rather than voices, although I do love to talk to people. Interesting to think about the senses more and new technologies to develop… Communicating with others is vital for me. This i-pad is a fairly recent method of doing it. I now use it a lot to check references and send emails. I use face-time every now and then to talk to my sister who is working in Cambodia. Actually this project, and using the Evernote with it, has opened up new ways of communicating for me. I don't really agree with what Rebecca Solnitt says about communication. I have lived alone, just waiting desperately for a phone call or a letter that never came. Now it is great that there are more channels to communicate with, even though it might just be with yourself. So I'm saying that all forms of digital communication can be good emails, texting, FaceTime, Facebook. It is a matter of how you choose to use it and, as we use it more, conventions appear, to ease the process of these new ways of sharing each other's words and thoughts. Virtual relationships can never match the importance of real ones, simply because there is no touch or closeness of bodies and voices. Just the presence of another person in a room is enough to transform the space you both occupy. Dialogue. Moving deep reflection. It is wonderful to see you, Sue, your daughter Bex and grandchild… it has been so intimate getting to know them through your words and then seeing their pictures somehowing bringing them together – making them more complete. Whole. Lovable. Bex Don't watch it Daddy. You know how it will make you feel. Peter (returning) Well, I watched it as you knew I would and yes, it was harrowing. I’ve move Pieta Peter to Day 7! It needed to belong amongst the facebook musings and gangs… I like the fact you are ‘contrary’, I think your family see it and know it and secretly like it!;) The EarA picture of the inner ear, amazing. Bella, whose book I have been reading while I have been doing the project, wrote about how she lost her hearing at 27, struggled to accept it, then struggled over using hearing aids as I did ( I was 33 but it might have been earlier), and then finally had a very new and possibly tricky operation in France to restore her full hearing. She was suffering from otosclerosis which is treatable by a skilled surgeon. The diagram shows the inner ear in detail, and where i to investigate further it would probably replicate in words how the surgeon travelled through her ear, one of the most complex organs we have, more than the brain even. Bella's hearing loss was not like mine, the nerve cell dying, but. could be completely restored which unfortunately mine can't, but, reader I manage wonderfully well. If you will allow me to explain: on the landline phone today I was talking to Zahidah over the difficult issue of being a guarantor for Shirl's son's London rent. Shirl can't be it because she lives in Cambodia, rehabilitating girls who have been trafficked to China, and returned, spoiled in the eyes of their families. This makes her ineligible for some ill-defined reason. Well, you might think Zahidah would be sympathetic to Shirl and the trafficked girls, being a woman and all that, but when I mentioned it in passing she did not respond how terrible! but let my comment pass on unremarked. In the end she explained what I had to do and I noticed that I had got used to the timbre of her voice, (as we hearing lost people do). I had asked her to speak louder (not shouting) and more clearly which she did. The upshot is that I am now in a position to fill in the form which will help my sister. So should I blame Zahida, reader, for her lack of empathy with my sister and the girls, or should I turn away and forget about it as observers of some other genocides may have done? Where does responsibility begin and end?

Conversational Pieces… I think your stories need to become ‘plays/conversational pieces’… lets look at this later… 2, 000 lines of Beowulf. The Nags Head in Great Linford where we shared our stories. ‘I am going to get on the inside of Chris and let him tell Pete's story, the story Pete tries to avoid telling; and so Chris will tell the story which Pete cannot, has never really been able to tell because it is so close to him; yes, now Chris, his friend, will tell it.’ His Mum was indomitable.

Beautiful Sue, the Ginger Cat and the omniscient narrator, reader, author, writer, singer, dancer, teller of stories, seafarer, wayfarer, shape-shifter, creator, restorer, life-giver, healer, healed. Day twenty something, trying out a conversational pieceNow reader, I have returned to this story because I loved the picture of the nurse you put in and I wanted to consider my friendship with Chris again. The dialogue is between me and an unspecified interlocutor. The StoryAbout ten years ago now, and time passes in great swathes doesn't it reader? Chris decided to leave his wife, Sue, with whom he had two children. Leave his wife? For god's sake, Pete, why? Why? Well, because Chris had overreached himself in his job as an educational adviser and had had some sort of breakdown that put him off work sick for about six months. Really, and what happened when he was ill? Well, his wife, Sue, was less than impressed, because if you think I'm a performer, then Chris is more so. Chris could hold an audience of 500 people in his palm and make them laugh while he told them about the follies of the education system and how he was going to help them improve it. Yes, I know all that, but did you say that Sue didn't help him when he was ill? No, I didn't say that. She did help him because she couldn't allow the main man to crumble completely, but she was also a bit pleased that he was getting his come-uppance. Really! Well that wasn't very nice. No, I know, but marriage can get a bit like that can't it, a sort of tussle between personalities? Anyway, while Sue was holding the fort, taking care of the children, who were now teenagers, someone else was helping Chris. Someone else ? What are you telling me here? I'm telling you what happened. A colleague on the advisory team, a bit younger than him, and single and, incidentally originally from Liverpool, came round to see him a couple of times. From Liverpool? How does that fit in? It doesn't really, except that he once said that both his best friend and his lover were from Liverpool. His lover? Haven't you jumped a bit here? Yes, I'm sorry, I wanted to get to the point. As we swam up and down the pool and, after he'd gone back to work, Christold me how he had started an affair with a colleague. With the colleague who had come round to see him? Yes, that's right. She wasn't one of the nurses then? No, and I'm being serious now so listen. Ok, I'm all ears. Well, eventually, the whole thing with the colleague got really intense and he told Sue. Told her! How did she react to that then? How did she react? Well, you've heard of Armageddon haven't you? Mmmm… Well it was like that and a bit more. Really, and hadn't they just had their silver wedding anniversary? Yes, my Sue and I had been to it, and of course, so had the colleague. You mean the one? Yes, I do mean that Oh my god, what happened next? Well of course Sue chucked him out, and I advised him to go and live on his own for a bit to work things through. Oh yes, typical Pete. A moment to reflect and all that, and did he? Did he what? Did he go off and reflect? No, of course not. He moved in with Deb straight away. Into her willing arms? Yes. So if the nurses had appeared, you would have had to handle them both then? I think you're teasing me. Yes, I amScene 2And what happened about the children? Now, that's a difficult one. The upshot is that Emily, has maintained her relationship with Chris, but won't see Deb, who is in fact now married to her Dad… She didn't go to the wedding then? You're joking. No, I'm just interested. I suppose you went? Yes, I did. What was it like? Well, it was sort of white, because Deb had always wanted a special wedding, not in church though, neither of them are religious. Thank goodness for that. God would probably have something to say. Now you're being flippant. Sorry, you can carry on with the story. What about Sam? Sam? That is almost unbearable. I was his godfather you know and I suppose I have some responsibility. No you don't, Pete, and we don't need a guilt trip here. Just tell me about Sam. Ok, well Chris hasn't seen his son for over ten years because Sam just refuses to have anything to do with him. You're kidding me. Didn't they do all that rugby together, and weren't they just like Chris and his own Dad had been before he died? Didn't you tell me that? Yes, I did, but Sam has cut off all communication. The only time Chris saw him was at his Mum's funeral, and that was just briefly from the other side of the room. And nothing since then? That's right, nothing. Well that's a right mess, was it worth it do you think? I suppose it must have been for him. He was in l love.

This research could be seen as 'free form', inviting us to express ourselves however we want to with just triggers that we can pick up and run with. Can you write a ‘Ghazal… that would be wonderful – maybe instead of your Day 9 as you are brilliantly and committed to this project and I’m playing catch up with others and at risk of neglecting the ability to timely respond also to those who like you are beautifully ‘running with it’… thank you… And I am juggling 23year olds, single Dads, my Mother, those retired, working mothers and the potential list goes on and is beautiful varied and unpredictable – and yet so very rich much like most of life I guess! J Dear Alice, I've just read this about you going on Arvon courses as I was trawling the days for some response from you. My first Arvon course was lovely. And transformative for me in a way you won't mind hearing, I'm sure. There were many women there. I was the only man, apart from one other student and the two tutors. I had written a poem about The Mill Chimney as suggested by the Tutor, Martin Booth. I had searched for it, shouted in it and produced the poem. That night we were drinking and I noticed that Irmtraud, a German woman, was coming on to one of the tutors. I had a feeling he wasn't going to take her up and he didn't do it. A bit craftily I positioned myself so she would come on to me during the rest of the course. She was older than me and was about five years old in Germany at the end of the war when RAF planes machine gunned the field where she was playing with friends and had to hide in a ditch. No-one was killed and she escaped but it scared her.. On the last day of the course we all read our poems, and then Liz Lochhead, our guest came on and gave a mesmerising performance. The next day Irmtraud asked me to come back to Manchester on the train with her. And I did. Never was anything so exciting. No-one Alice in he world knew where I was or who I was with, except Irmtraud. We got to her house and you can guess what happened without me having to go into detai. Needless to say I felt pretty good. That night she went to her job as a Tyrolean Waitress ia restaurant in Manchester, leaving me in her house alone with my thoughts. I stayed with her that night and the next one and the next. It became a sort of mini-relationshi, the need being on both our sides. She was divorced and had a son. She was older than me but it didn't matter how much and I can't work it out. I was 31 or 32. The relationship gradually fell away, painlessly. I couldn't drive then except on the bike, which wasn't the one in the picture, I was being dishonest and you must have picked it up. But Irmtraud and I visited each other a few times by train. I have a picture of her which I could put here if you think it is right and the real bike, a red 100cc Suzuki on which I passed my test first time. It's interesting but I've just remembered another story. It's later now, post Irmtraud, and I have met this woman on some course or other and visited her at her place but clearly not much is going to happen. (No chemistry, a phrase I would learn in the dating game that I now had to play). Anyway, during our nothing happening, she gives me to understand that in order to have any success in the dating game I will need a car, and not just any car. Some of her friends, she tells me, define a man by the car he drives. Oh my God, this whole thing is turning out to be a lot more complicated than I thought. I can't drive and I keep failing the wretched test. (There is a reason because the motor bike one was easy, but I haven't yet realised what it is.) More next week. It is now the second year, post Viv, and for some reason even harder than the first. The main achievement so far is that I have given up smoking with some help from a T. V programme led by Chas and Dave, and now I am no longer consuming an ounce of Old Holborn, or Sun Valley, or Golden Virginia every day. Work is dreadful. I don't do any preparation, and no marking, and have frequent run ins with children, mainly boys. 'Rafaelli, you little bastard, get in line. ' Is a typical poem from that period, not good at all. Luckily, there is a life-line available. Anne Pennell at Bedford College, where I was doing a short course on Science teaching when Viv left, and who I told about it, has suggested I do an Advanced Dip Ed in Science Education and I have started it. Somehow this course, and Anne and her husband Fred's support, enable me to survive teaching at Sandye Place. I devise a quite extraordinary Year 8 project on Time which involves all sorts of exciting experiments about how to measure it. There now began a very creative two year spell of teaching, but I was always a performer, retiring at the end of the day behind the stage to collapse in what must have been a post something depression. Then my G. P. whose son I had taught and who knew all about the events in Sandy. (I was public property, and I even had to teach the two daughters and son of my wife's lover.) referred me to Dr Perl in Bedford. Fantastic man. When at our first meeting I said to him that I couldn't understand why I wasn't getting over the divorce more quickly. It was two whole years! (After all, people were saying to me that, 'I had to get back on the horse. ' He said, 'Two years, well, that's par for the course, ' which lifted a whole weight from my shoulders. Courses for horses, reader, if you are still there. At this point there is the trip to America. In August 1982 I travelled to America. I had been invited over by Arthur, a friend from my student days whom I had met in New York in 1970. He had contacted me again by ringing Mum in Liverpool to find out where I was and what I was doing. She had told him about the divorce and my need for friends at that time. He was by now a steward with Pan-Am and made routine flights to Heathrow, staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Knightsbridge. We met there a few times, even went to see Bob Dylan together. How curious, on our return from the concert, there was a racist incident on the tube which I somehow broke up, saying 'Stop! ' in my best teacherly manner. The perpetrators slunk away telling me. 'it's not racial, mate, ' which it clearly was, and the victims retreated together to the next compartment. Anyway, I digress. The upshot of the Sheraton visits was that Arthur invited me to New York, to his apartment, where he lived with Sandra and Jesse, and from where I was to launch out on my Amelrican journey. He went with me to buy a rucksack for the journey and a 15 day Greyhound Ameripass. He then took me to the Port Authority in Manhattan and waved me off at about 11 o'clock in the evening. His advice on entering and leaving bus terminals was to always appear that I knew what I was doing. I was to remember that later. My initial destination was Washington and to get there I travelled through Philadelphia and Baltimore. I arrived some time in the afternoon and immediately sought out the youth hostel. It was in a very sleazy part of the city, full of hard-core book and video shops, but the place itself was full and friendly. In no time at all I was talking to an Australian girl called Anne. She asked if she could travel round with me, and together we visited The Washington Monument and other places of interest. We stood outside the railings at the Whitehouse, watching Vietnam veterans in wheelchairs protesting. On my last visit in 1970, I remembered that friends of Arthur's were going to Canada to avoid the draft. Anne was blonde and attractive. She wore red shorts with a white stripe down the side. I was pleased with the companionship and as we toured around we talked quite freely about our lives. I remember us both lying side by side on our stomachs in one of the parks. I wondered whether I should try to kiss her but am glad now that I didn't. I stayed in Washington for two or three days and finally parted from Anne to travel south. She was going north to New York. As I left I noticed that she was already sounding out an American with a beard to be her next travelling companion. The next stop I made was in Knoxville. Tennessee. This was a total contrast to my previous stop and here I met Floy Bell who ran the international youth hostel there as a sort of semi-religious refuge from the world. She was pleasant enough but the spiritual weirdness of 'Bell's Wa-Floy Retreat' got me down after a while and I was soon ready to move on. I decided to head down to New Orleans. I was by now becoming familiar with Greyhound Bus travel and if it was possible to take up two sears I would. Also, I could sleep on the bus, something I found useful if I didn't want to make an overnight stop. At various points on the journey things happened. The first was when I intervened to stop a man from harassing a girl on the bus. There was a commotion from the back and she came rushing down from her seat to where I was sitting and flopped down next to me. A moment later a heavily built white man appeared and tried to get her to return to the back of the bus with him. I half stood and in my best English accent told him to leave her alone, fully expecting to receive a punch in the jaw for my trouble. But it didn't happen and he returned to his seat. The girl appeared to be from the Middle East. She was very flustered and, although I tried to find it what had happened, she didn't want to talk to me, so I didn't press her.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":17,"midCount":9,"highCount":11,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":238,"file":"peter noticings/Day 15.

I quite like that. Wherever I live I nest, be it a camping trip for a short weekend, where I'm sure to be hanging out bunting, making an ah hoc kitchen and setting beds. In the past it was my first seventies brown student digs, where in a day I had instantly transformed it into an Elmer the elephant coloured space… and now in my grown up house I nest and enjoy cosy evenings in winter by a warm fire. I nested a lot in preparation for my pregnancies. I never quite figured out the compulsion I had for wanting to take a dirty rug to the dry cleaners a few weeks before my eldest daughter was born. No matter how much my nesting instinct took over, I couldn't physically shift the rug. Ed was not having a bar of it, so it never did get cleaned. I spent a good few hours in labour on all fours on that flipping rug it could have at least smelt a bit better!! I get huge pleasure from building my nest and admiring my space. I love to decorate my little girls rooms with bright colours and make it a sanctuary of comfort for them. I love the way they create nests for their teddies. On our visit to Tokyo I recall Helena tucking all her teddies up in hotel slippers. ( I will find you the photos we took.) We were far away in one of the largest cities in the world l, all the hustle and bustle that was going on outside and in her 2 year old mind, her peppa pig, gruffalo mouse, kiwi bird and teddy were nested! I seem to recall there is a schema in early childhood development where nesting is a learnt and practiced behaviour. Endless games of hide and seek and den building with Helena and Imogen. They have both loved to feel secure and safe in their early nests. I too remember in childhood building secret dens, tree house and hideouts. The secrecy and excitement they provided. A place to make potions, smoke cigarettes and hide from donkeys! I even remember making my bedroom in to a rainforest. Green light bulb and vines hung from the ceiling. I also recall an 'Emily ' nest box that I could see from out of my bedroom window. I've lived in some hard nests too. A bit like the nests that the collared doves in my back garden tree attempt to build (and fail) every year. It's hopeless but they still try or forget they did the year before. As soon as a strong wind comes all the sticks that make up their love nest blow away. Sadly leaving little broken egg shells onThe lawn. Not being in a happy nest is horrible and trapping. It's disappointing and feels like a holding place. There has been nests where Ive needed to get away from. The one in Yorkshire with the ex boyfriend. This was like living as an old person nothing dynamic going on there. The only option was to take flight and flee that nest. My wings held out. I suppose all homes are A form of nest that can hold so many emotions and experiences. Once it's occupants are gone … do the bricks and mortar hold on to a sense of the people who occupied it? I think the energy in different buildings and places needs to be heard, and can be felt too sometimes.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidhighhighhigh","lowCount":13,"midCount":3,"highCount":5,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":245,"file":"emily responses/Day 10: Response","title":"Day 10: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:51:25","text":"Reading the stories merged together, elicited this snippet of a conversation I had with my younger sister about a year ago… 'It's funny how isn't it? ''What? ''It's not how a person is… it's how they make you feel… 'don't you think? '' Yes I know' 'That man, he's strange. '… 'yes' I said. ' I've often thought that. I always cross the street if I see himself coming' 'He makes me feel uncomfortable too.. 'My inner dialogue is saying. Maybe he's ill, maybe he's got some kind of memory loss or dementia. Maybe I need to go easy on him, be less judgemental… Or maybe not… he just makes me feel odd. I don't like my children near him. He's too interested in my children. Protect them keep them away from his straying walking stick. Another incident with the walking stick man on a different day. He walks down the street, I'm in the company of my husband today. Confrontational, gut response. Husband : 'Keep away from my children. You fucking pervert! ' He lurches out with! Walking stick Man: ' oooh she's crying' he said 'pick her up' he said. 'Yes Daddy that's how she likes it' he said. In that moment I felt sick. His tone of voice was all wrong. This traction point was all about the tone… the emotion and intention in his voice. I always get cross with my husband for swearing in front of the kids, not this time. I really felt my suspicions were right. I needed to keep him far away from my children. Every time I see him now I cross the street. I think the 'sexually assaulted' part of our merged stories really triggered this conversation in me. The sense of vulnerability in others. The journeys that we all go on alone, that inner dialogue that we all experience bonds us. It's like when you think of someone, and then they call you. The vulnerability and the beauty that comes from it. The stories threaded together share a sense of needing to belong, comforted and connected. In someways this made me think of the walking stick man. He wanted to reach out to us, to my children, to touch, to perhaps engage with their vulnerability. Wrong desire in the wrong hands.

Abba and good company. 'Take a chance on me'Once my guest had got over his slightly suspicious and weary approach to the evening he enjoyed it. He needed to find out why I had decided to hold a transformative celebration and what it was all about! Facts given he was satisfied he could relax and I wasn't going to spring some maypole dancing on him! He brought with him a music playlist that were all songs that reminded him of me. As we exchange many stories about these moments. We chatted about photographs we had of happy times together, of actual photographs and those held in his head. The happy sad and curious. The times alone, as a young free couple and then the times when our babies arrived and grew. It was a soft and gentle summery evening. I embraced the pagan nature of the celebration and came dressed in my pretty bohemian dress. I felt fairy like, floral and free! It's a Swedish tradition to wear flower garlands. So I dressed with one and one for my guest! I scattered the table with rose petals (for you Al) you can have them back I saved them. Then out crawled a little furry caterpillar. I was about to throw it into the garden. Then I thought about its transformation yet to come and I was happy he'd found shelter in my rose petals for a while as he prepared for his own transformation. The darkness closed in and the garden faded as the last flowers disappeared into the darkness. I was anxious it might feel like enforced fun, but allowing myself to not hold any high expectations of how successful it was going to turn out allowed me to be appreciate the experience for what it was. A summer celebration, a celebration of light and long days. I think honouring the pagan tradition felt right and beautiful. It was a tender evening, as tender as the month of June.

People with dementia believe their mothers to be with them. Why does dying person revert back to an almost womb like state. The is sure to be a deep routed connection that never really ceases it just erases from our consciousness… then returns as we enter a more vulnerable living frail existence . It is a link between all these questions and the womb. The need to be cradled and protected. Secure and embodied in times of vulnerability, illness and death we are as in need of protection as the new born baby. Child's pose, fetal pose, it is no surprise they feel safe and allow us to go inside ourselves and perhaps our mothers once more. Babies reform their new born bodies into the womb position. They gradually lose this but even on the outside want to honour this space for a short while longer. Even though they can now be free to stretch far and wide. As a mother of a stillborn daughter I know that this womb space can still forever be occupied within our hearts. I once read that you didn't grow under my heart but in it. The womb is love, pure and vital. I felt cradled, held by my small dead child. She held me as much as I had longed and I held her. (And still do) then I felt as her mother that I released her soul from my heart into her and she became part of nature once again.","mood":"lowlowlowhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":10,"midCount":3,"highCount":6,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":251,"file":"emily responses/Day 18: Response","title":"Day 18: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-27 12:07:40","text":"My response: What is your Drag?

I try to deal with situations with humour or at least secretly see the humour in them. What Grounds you? Home, time alone to do things in my own time. Flowers and colours, walking in nature. Reflection but not too much. Music whatever mood I'm in whatever place i reside music gives me comfort, happiness, security and company. Holding people in my heart. Respecting the space they have left. How do you keep afloat or in flight? I practise yoga and walk meditatively. I surround myself with nurturing friends and family. I love the company of others but also my own solitude too so I have to keep a balance of both. What propels you forward? (Your huge heart? Your memory of where to find nourishment? Your ability to adapt? Your ability to change direction and focus on what resources you have within you? Your ability to drop excess baggage?) My ability to be with others, to listen and comfort. My desire to learn from others and allow this to shape me. My ability to wear many hats and keep many plates spinning. My resilience in times of vulnerability. My respect for my own vulnerability and others. This short clip made me think about maths and numbers. The whole sensation of numbers, as a feeling an emotion. The ability to learn and grow by being in the number not just a passive recipient of it. Much more thrust and grounding involved in this process. Let's look at Dr. Montessori's philosophy of life and education, in the founder's own words: And so we discovered that education is not something which the teacher does, but that it is a natural process which develops spontaneously in the human being. It is not acquired by listening to words, but in virtue of experiences in which the child acts on his environment. The teacher's task is not to talk, but to prepare and arrange a series of motives for cultural activity in a special environment made for the child.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidhighhighhigh","lowCount":12,"midCount":3,"highCount":7,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":252,"file":"emily responses/Day 16: Response","title":"Day 16: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-27 12:05:11","text":"I can remember my chrysalis it's the light seeping through the holes of the orange stitching in my 70s zoo animal sleeping bag as I hide in my bed or slide down the stairs! The security I felt in that hidden cosiness . A feeling of anticipation and joy. Will I remain trapped? Can I come up for air? Will my sister get off me it's hurting now. I've had enough I need To get out, cool down… As a child I was always surrounded by others for company. As I e grown older I value my own solitude. Being contrary though it's a great priveledgr to have close Sisters, parents, friends. Who act as guides to ease life's pains and mistakes, as we as share joy and achievement. As a child I had a sense if being loved and surrounded by love. In someways my chrysalis was hard to break free from. I was always told I couldn't cope with change, that I didn't adjust well. So secure perhaps, was I in my homely shell I, I found it hard to break out off, and didn't question why I needed too. That and this was confirmed on school trips away when I'd feel homesick even when my dad was there! From a young age I could spend time observing and listening. Creating ideas and thinking about people. I've always thought about people. being in the middle of a family this is a given. So as a teenager it was about sneakiness and mainly quiet rebellion. I rebelled enough just not in a shouty way. Enough to test the water safely. Smoking, drinking, going out with unsuitable boys in fast cars, I did all of that but kept most quiet fromMy family. I was secure in my friendships and they enabled me to shed some of my skin. Test new boundaries and develop new ideas and experiences. Someone once said to me once we live our lives backwards really. By this they meant that it's only at the end of our life that we are truly wise. I disagree I think I was naively wise then now I am probably less wise and sneaky, but More vulnerable and honest. I'm not sure if a young wise person or vulnerable honest person is forwards or backwards progress… even progress at all. Perhaps it's just way of acknowledging that experiences shape you and you choose how to shape yourself as a result of them. My soul is the same, I just express different parts of it. I'm not sure you ever really truly know yourself. It's a constant process, a 'noticing the gaps' process. As an older adult I chose a safe boyfriend and the chrysalis sleeping bag returned after the teenage hormones subsided. I spent happy years with him, but there was no fire in my belly. No dynamic that would change. I was unknowingly at first taking an alternative mind path that wasn't going to rejoin with his. My rebellion wasn't over I had regain part of my sneaky and rebellious teenage self. Longing for complete change, dynamism, and youthful fun. I spread my wings, but for a time there age 24 was 'becoming'. I think it's safe to say I still put my toes in that 70s sleeping bag at times, but it's not been zipped up since she 24! Where is my secret dwelling place now…, In a peaceful meadow, long orange grass and open blue skies. I Think this really means, a quietened heart, that flutters when I make those I love happy. For that in turn provides me with my happiness. (In some ways this is my muscle memory too) the need to touch others. A heart that searches for beauty in the spaces the in between. A heart that has a secret intrigue of where we all go next in this life time and the one after, and a joy that sacred souls will always stay bonded. The butterfly quote… from tidbinbilla. For my grandma. On the day she died I saw this and thought about her 98 years. We love each day but the years go fast twisting and turning out sense of time becomes tangible. Warped.

Sometimes it's grounding to be reminded of this, sometimes it's a bit too grounding and superficiality becomes quite appealing but unobtainable. I remember age 19, an elderly man dying on a ward in Leeds. I a student nurse, was expected to learn 'last offices' I helped lay out this gentleman after he'd died, with my nursing mentor. A caring and kind lady.. I remember the care she gave to him, how tender she was. The care she showed to me, to guide me through the clinically spiritual process. We went about our work, quietly and respectfully. Then as we stepped out of the curtains we resumed normal work again. The living still needed our care.

Attention- a sense of feeling loved and adored. For someone to be attentive towards you, they act in a way that makes you feel special, thought about, and present with you in that moment. Attention involves a deep genuineness towards the other. A desire to give your attention. It needs concentration and discipline at times so the other person feels you are being attentive. 2. Acceptance when a person allows you to be you. Non judgemental view on who you are. Able to see you in some perspective in times of conflict and annoyance. The longer and compassionate view. Facilitating you to accept yourself perhaps. 3. Appreciation- actions speak louder than words perhaps? In this sense this is the pure material meaning of the word. Tokens of appreciation can speak volumes. Flowers, meals, a Friday night take away, a surprise visit, treasures you give to a loved one to show you love them, think about them. That anticipation and joy when a person receives a gift they love. Sharing with each other. Being able to acknowledge when a person is trying to show love towards you. Even when times are hard it's about making time to think and share what you appreciate about them. Even if you have to dig deep. 4. Affection loving oneself, but also allowing your loved one to give affection. Affection is more of a physical term for me. It's the actual act of kissing, hugging, sexual intimacy. It's an appreciation of your body, your sense of masculinity or feminity and the attraction to one another drives affection. However the part of affection that is perhaps more ambiguous, is that It is also gentle and caring. Affection is physically transient but the emotional effect endures beyond the physical display. 5. Allowing- this to me is about 'going with it' part of a relationship, especially when energy is low or communication is tricky. There is something about allowing that may become a trigger that leads to conflict if the cycle of 'who is allowing who' is not gauged correctly between one another. Conflict between each other for example in situations where disagreements arise. Being able to overcome, grow and 'allow' for space between these turbulent times to reflect on what it is that drives the clash of opinion. Working through these experiences either together or apart and 'allowing' yourself and other person to feel how they need to feel, or to do what they need to do. This also involves a degree of self compassion so that one person is not always the 'allower' and the other person is the allowed! Balance is part of allowing. Balancing and being able to allow your own voice to be heard. Not overshadowing that other person. Not being blinkered to your own voice and stifling the other. He says that by giving and receiving these five A's, relationships become deeper and more meaningful, and they become a ground for personal transformation. I invite you today to consider what these words might mean to you, how do you create a sense of these for yourself… for others… how does it feel when someone else gives these qualities to you? Have you experienced their opposites…","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidhigh","lowCount":15,"midCount":5,"highCount":1,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":255,"file":"emily responses/Day 19: Response","title":"Day 19: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-27 12:08:35","text":"Emily's wheel of life Analysis, So although I spend a lot of time helping others I have rated this as the largest area of fulfilment. Just as well with young children, a tired husband and a job dedicated to helping others I am glad to see that although I've recognised 'compassion fatigue' within myself at times, But i clearly get a great sense of enjoyment and fulfilment fromIt. So on some ways helping others is allowing me to help myself. It certainly challenges me so that's why I've marked it as EIn a par with this is 'Creativity' at a score of 10. Although I would like more time to be creative in a time boxed way. However I think I am good at seeing the creative in In most parts of my life. I like to think I have some capacity to be creative anywhere. At work I have to be spontaneously creative, think on my feet and expect the unexpected. There is a lot of dynamism about this. The garden, growing flowers, children's craft projects, working with clay, collecting shells, decorating my home, watching films, music, radio, reading all allow me to top up my creativity. H or E?? Friends and family rated at 10. I am very fortunate to have an amazing family. I get support and care from them as well and love and social enjoyment. My friends although spread far and wide, the majority I feel in contact with. Sometimes I wish I could put more into friends, and this puts my sense of fulfilment down a bit. I'd like to see some friends more often but I accept that other parts of my life need to have more of my energy right now. There are four parts of the wheel that score at 8. I'm wondering if that means I'm balanced or spreading myself too thinly?! Love and Relstonships. I am secure and satisfied with my relationship with my husband. I think we are often under pressure, we both set ourselves targets, driven to achieve. I would say we are both quite eudaemonical with our focus. We clash more over hedonimic aspects of our lives. We know we both need to support each other to 'self nurture' and we try to give each other space to do this. However when the butter is spread thinly, and there's only one piece of toast, who's going to eat it?! Me him? No the kids win every time. Is see it as a gentle tug of war. The thrust, drag, Pull and lift of our relationship is directed by external pressures and family. Perhaps we could do better at accepting the space we need and be more regimented about it. I think we are both pretty patient people. I'll leave this with one quote 'Shall we stay in bed all day and eat sweeties? 'my relationship goal! Work and finance: This is an area that I hold my hands up to not feeling very 'in control' of or feeling the need to be. In my relationship I'm the less dominant lead on this. My earning potential and capacity is suport my family financially is limited. I value my ability to support them emotionally and practically in different ways. I don't get fulfilment in a balancing the books sense. I get more fulfilment because I feel privileged to have a husband that supports our family financially and this allows me to have opportunities that we might not otherwise get. I am not able to contribute but this is limited and sometimes the work I do does not get the equivalent financial rewards it deserves. As a nurse we do not get recognised by government for the work we do. In the wider world the jobs about money get money. The jobs about people, care, education, creativity serve people much more, but give less financial recognition. This is an inverse system where money is what makes the world go round. Acts of kindness, love and time is really what gives us meaning. Heart Over head Practical Over Emotional Fun and recreation Evokes a sense of freedom, dancing, singing and sparkles of colour. Times with good people Times learning, expanding my mind art galleries, big cities, on a beach, live music, a dark cinema seat taking me into another world. It brings out the hedonistic, optimistic joyful inner child. In the company of good friends I become high on life! Regular doses of this are essential for fulfilment and release of pent up aggression, fear and stagnation. My image of sparkle and fun My sound of fun and escapism Drop the pressure. Really fucking loud. Preferably in a fast car. Physical Activity This is in someways more my spiritual side. Being physically active I get a sense of my 'outer self' running or walking in solitude gives me time to communicate with myself. I think a lot. I process a lot of what I experience 'in the world. 'I notice small things going on in life, a new lamb, a thrown away TV set on the roadside, a newly ploughed field. Potholes filled with rainwater on the tarmac. It brings me to a meditative state yoga bends my mind as well as my body. It is about the physical body aswell as the mental health of ones mind. Yoga is my MOT. It's brought me time to work through life's strains. It allows me to notice my body and my mind as a whole. So really I could get more fulfilment if I did more of this, but instead I appreciate what I do do. Physicality in my old job used to allow me to feel the touch I gave to my patients was nurturing them. I sometimes miss that. I don't miss the strain of this on my body. I think I almost felt 'worn out' with it. Health and Wellbeing I had a rather traumatic beginning to this year, this has had a huge impact on how I feel now. This is why it rateslowest in fulfilment for me right now. Although on a positive note it's much higher and more balanced than it would have been a few months ago… transformation happening here! I am 'getting' there and I think all the other aspects of the wheel reflect this. I am feeling much more stable and able to have perspective on what's happened and where I've come… My work as a cancer wellbeing soecialist I am primarily working with the health a wellbeing of others. Therefore I know what I should be doing but don't always give myself that permission to nurture my own wellbeing. I am learning.

As a learning process I've observed what works well for me and what doesn't. The natal map made me think of a Dandelion clock. The circle of the map became a bit like a half blown dandelion clock. As I blew it away some bits still stuck. Out of those hundreds of seeds there were still points that were unconscious or not ready to take flight into the world A little like the model of a Johari window, of what others see and I do not. What I see and know and others don't, what others and I both do not see or know. I loved the contradictory part of this. It helped me to understand multidimensional aspects of myself. The clashes that cause psychological disturbance within me at times. Like the dandelion clock. Some clusters of seeds may never take route, some blow away, some grow and develop. Others will be a weedy pain, some will make more delight, generations of dandelion clocks for little children to blow. Some will just stick to your clothes and get put in the wash. Others will jump out at times you least expect. Some are gentle, some are fragile. Some get lost in the grass, some stand out vibrantly, some take to the sky or even the stars.

It stifles conversations, stops present enjoyment in the here and now. I see this n myself too and evenings where I've set about to do something nice… read a book… phone a friend… I find myself two hours later lost in my phone apps with finger and neck ache… It is no wonder that mindfulness and meditation are something that everyone craves. It's like we are all having to retrain our brains to become less active, less electronic to the constant stimulation around us. I am a Facebook user, but I call it nose book really. I am not entirely comfortable about sharing my world with everyone else. This is not because I don't embrace sharing, celebration and connecting with others. In all honesty it doesn't give me the connection I need. It's third hand observation with a unknowing undertone of competitiveness. I see stories of friends weekend plans, religious thoughts, new babies, birthday, memes of wisdom, glamorous holidays, adverts for the latest yoga leggings, news that a person has just donated their eggs, news there is a fete in the next village next Saturday, news of birth and death, happy times, tragedy, news fromDown under summertime and up over British wintertime… the paradoxes, clashes and sheer volume of information is overwhelming. Just a click of a button and we get our selves down many a rabbit hole… instead of feeling grateful for this connection with others, I start to feel overloaded, dumbed down, encroached upon… STOP I want to be gracious about all this but I cant find it in me the capacity to reach our genuinely to each and everyone of you.

G'day, My birthday. 2012. First November 28th spent in 28 degrees early Aussie summer. I shouldn't have been surprised after all everything had turned on its head that year. Winter had become Summer. Dressing gown had become flip flops. Birth had become death and the togetherness of other birthdays became solitude. Sleeping under red canvas, this orangery red like that of a enclosed womb space. Waking up to the sound of the Australian dawn chorus. The laughter of the kookaburra quite the opposite to my own desire to laugh. Glad he was happy all the same. Alone in a tent. Alone with my thoughts. Age 32. Feeling at least double this. Wondering if I should be 32 to anyway. My birthday had not even arrived in the depths of English winter. It would have been 27th November there… I'd Never had a birthday before where I'd woken alone. Birthdays aren't really alone things. They are to be shared. That said I was happy to share it peacefully with myself. My cards laid out the night before, on the bright rag rug under my camp bed. As I opened them I gave my thought and love to every person that had shared their wishes with me. Treasured their handwriting as a unique part of them. Their spirit with me. Although the difference with this birthday was I wasn't really alone, and never for any other birthday would I be again. I had birthed my own angel only a few months before. I held her as the greatest of all gifts that morning. The mist of my grief I saw her gift. In the nature all around me, of which she and I were a part of. The last night of 31 there was a tremendous thunderstorm. Inside the tent, alone I experienced the force of nature, the elements at their most fierce. I trusted that shelter to keep me safe and dry to protect me to house me on to the threshold of 32. It did. I needed to begin to trust nature again. My own nature had let me down, my body had not sustained a life for a long as it needed. or perhaps really it hadn't it had just become something else entirely. Out of my control. A a gentle morning followed. Turbulent times have to surrender to calmer horizons. A day spent in yoga poses, swimming amongst water Lilly pads. A symbol of serenity. In some ways this wasn't my younger self. It was an older self back then. I'm learning to be younger again. Freer and more accepting of the inner me. My needs don't always shout out, I sometimes need to just listen to the whispers. But why would this surprise me? As I said it was an upside down birthday that year. My walk to the corner shop to get cat food. Noticings along the way. Natures angels, Look both ways, Nourish your power, Looking after, careStay close. One day you will be reborn. I learnt all that glad we'd run out of cat food. 🐈II","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowhighhighhigh","lowCount":15,"midCount":2,"highCount":5,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":261,"file":"emily responses/Day 5: Response Tickle Time day 5","title":"Day 5: Response Tickle Time day 5","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:45:35","text":"Tickle Time.

I invited him to walk the ten minute walk into town as we both stepped out of our houses at the same time. Other than neighbourly pleasantries we have only really had brutish polite contact. His wife committed suicide only 6 weeks ago. He is in the midst of grief and suffering deep sadness. After his loss and I felt I needed to reach out to him. Only a few days before I had left a sunflower on his doorstep in the hope that this would trigger some contact, bring him some light. It was a chance meeting after I'd tried to make contact but he wasn't there. As we walked into town he thanked me for the sunflower politely. He said he neglected it for a few days and it had drooped. Sure enough after a little water it had picked back up. I felt this was a good image for him to focus on. As we walked and talked I thanked him for letting me in to his wife's world at her funeral. I praised his bravery and words. That was enough talking from me. I listened as he talked about his journey of grief so far. He told me about how it couldn't have been any other way. He said 'she was a strong woman- she needed to be present at her funeral' He felt acknowledgement in that moment. It felt good to him to say her name, I could tell. I reflected on grief it twists and turns it's transformations. ' It's a long journey' I said, 'one you have to be with'. ' I'm with it, he said. ' in at the stage where I wake in the morning and realise it's still true' I've just 'had that'. I looked at him, at his face, his determined focus to walk, his lack of eye contact, unshaven. EMERSIONWalking together there was no pressure for eye contact. We were side by side, walking together, a walking listening presence. He said 'People tell me I should go back to work, go back to normal'I thought it's never going to be normal, why could you enforce that on yourself? I said ' you do what you need' PROMPTHe said ' I lost a friend five years ago' I know I was angry I don't think anger is good. I can't let it eat me up this time''The whys have crept in, could I have done anything? I'm trying to let them be with me'I said 'you did all you could still it's so hard, and normal to ask why… 'REFLECTION As we neared thee d of the narrow walk way we'd just been through we parted ways. He was collecting his car, after a night out before drinking with friends. I was off to my yoga class. Outside was a queue of people waiting to go in. He saw someone he recognised, and clearly wanted to avoid. He broke off quickly and walked on. DETACHMENT It was an abrupt finish. The recognised lady said 'how's Sam?' 'It's hard for him' I said. This conversation made me feel grateful that we'd walked out our doors at the same time that morning. It's rare that I'm alone and free to talk. I wanted to convey my care and thoughts towards him. It started with a sunflower and ended with a powerful chat- one I could not have imagined ever having with this stoic British gentleman. In that moment he was a vulnerable shell of a man undergoing Sep transformation, adjusting to a life without his wife. Without what was. If I'd not stopped, offered a walk and talk his voice might not have been heard. Thank you. 'Love thy neighbour' The other day I poundered over her funeral service booklet. I looked at her photo of her smiling face with her back Labrador. I said my goodbyes once again and thoughtfully placed it into the recycling. I felt Wrong to do this but I didn't want to hold on to it. I wAs never going to read it again. It's hard to know what respectful and what's not… my intention when I placed it in there was for it to be reborn, transformed into a new book, a new story, made in someway from hers.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":12,"midCount":2,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":265,"file":"emily responses/Day 12: Response","title":"Day 12: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-26 19:53:03","text":"There we have it!

A place where your needs are met, without having to ask. Sounds and light blurred and dumbed down by the presence of a pulse beating. One big heart beating, comforting the tiny one that beats below it. Made from essence of male and female cell. A womb where the love of my sisters housed there before me have shared the same space. A forgotten but vital Space. Why do elderly people ask for their mothers. People with dementia believe their mothers to be with them. Why does dying person revert back to an almost womb like state. (That is so so interesting…) Babies reform their new born bodies into the womb position. They gradually lose this but even on the outside want to honour this space for a short while longer. Even though they can now be free to stretch far and wide. I once read that you didn't grow under my heart but in it. The womb is love, pure and vital. (This is so beautiful – it made me cry…) Love you Em. I felt cradled, held by my small dead child. She held me as much as I had longed and I held her. (And still do) then I felt as her mother that I released her soul from my heart into her and she became part of nature once again. (Yes I felt her too, holding us both as we held her…) I love you.

I am secure and satisfied with my relationship with my husband. I think we are often under pressure, we both set ourselves targets, driven to achieve. I would say we are both quite eudaemonical with our focus. We clash more over hedonimic aspects of our lives.

Sometimes it's grounding to be reminded of this, sometimes it's a bit too grounding. Emotional Fatique. I remember age 19, an elderly man dying on a ward in Leeds. I was expected to learn 'last offices'. I helped lay out this gentleman after he'd died with my nursing mentor a caring and kind lady. ‘I remember the care she gave to him, how tender she was. The care she showed to me, to guide me through the clinically spiritual process.’ We went about our work, quietly and respectfully. Then as we stepped out of the curtains we resumed normal work again. The living still needed our care. Like the thin veil between life and death the curtain mimicked this.

Last night there was a tremendous thunderstorm. Inside the tent, orangey-red. I experienced the force of nature, the elements fierce. I trusted the shelter to keep me safe, dry, warm. To protect me, house me, on the threshold of 32. It did. I begin to trust nature again. My own nature had let me down. My body had not sustained her life for a long as it needed. Or perhaps it had. She has just become something else entirely? Out of my control. Wild, strong, free. Part of me and a part from me dancing. Together. Turbulent times surrender to calmer horizons. Yoga poses swimming amongst waterlily pads. Sinking back at night underneath the water, born again in the light of the day. Padding and paddling. A symbol of serenity. Pink. Tall. Strong. Wise. A gentle morning. In some ways this wasn't my younger self. It was my older self. I'm learning to be younger again. Free, more accepting of inner Emil-me. My needs don't always shout out. Sometimes I just listen to the whispers. My walk to the corner shop to get cat food. Noticing’s along the way. I learnt all that. But why does this surprise me? Natures Angels. Look both ways when you cross the road. Hoppity Skippity. Nourish your power. Look after each other. Care. Stay close. And one day you will be reborn. A part from me, and a part of me dancing. Together. I was happy to share that peacefully with myself. As I said it was an upside down birthday that year.

I nest by choosing objects that have personal association, affective value, memory, imaginative resonance, objects of desire that make my home alive. I grow plants. I make tea which I get far away and bring home like birds. I appropriate family objects for my nest: great-grandmother's wardrobe, a cousin's mirror, mother's knitted shawl. Mostly I read books in bed. I open my nest to friends and cook us meals. Nesting is relaxation and clearing. I cannot but build nests wherever I live.

Manage with yourself and make a proper life that will ease trouble. Make your Mum and Dad proud for that matter, as that seemed to matter a lot more than a lot indeed. I had to be understood by my family. I had to understand and support them. Not much fun in the end. I started to break some rules and get lost. I even broke a knee for levity I had not learnt the rules to break them for the best. I underwent a whole doctoral study trying to be super-human.

Entrepreneurs are people skilled in building the interpersonal bridges that span structural holes. Remember my mother's blanket with holes? NOT COVERING THE HOLES! Illusion of filling the blanks. I had the idea that my mother (without knowing it) was actually speaking about her discomfort with structural holes, and not about holes in her knowledge.? New line of interpretation for my thesis. Gosh. Research never ends. This confirms my feeling that life is more satisfying when doing different things with different people there's more freedom and diversity in one live; there's an issue with keeping track with the social map which is a complex moveable map; there's some loneliness too as connections are fluid and intermittent. It becomes isolating if you have a difficulty with the frustration of fluid and intermittent relationships and do not flow in between the holes often enough. This social isolation may bring with it both lower social capital (lack of good opportunities) and cultural capital (it is more difficult to connect ideas). All this to say: great prompt! How is my blanket? I have tried to draw my map of academic relationships but it will need more work. It can be of great help to visualize moveable relational network. In my drawing the dynamic is not there yet, it looks static. Also missing 'potentials' between groups. And non academic people? For now that's a starting point!

I was a bit nervous a I knew I had kept her away and she had sensed that obviously, and as now offended as I could guess from her texts. Calling her on Monday 5th June at 8pm. GDN: Hi Mum. How was your exam today? and How was Naples? M: Exam went quite well, not so difficult. Naples was great. (pause) I am glad you ask but I was hurt by the way you traded me recently and that answer the other day about June and I don’t deserve that. GDN: Yes you are right. Could you tell me how I hurt you the other day? M: You treated me like another appointment which did not fit in your agenda. GDN: You are right. I am really busy at the end of the month, with Edinburgh and writing those articles, but you are right and I could have told you more carefully. I did not mean that. Fact is, I don’t know what to do. I need some space for myself and don’t like when you call me at any time of the day as if I were always available. I am working although unpaid.

M: I thought there was something wrong with that and you did no like the card. GDN: Well no it is so beautiful and I like it very much. Thank you.

I don’t feel adequate. M: I wanted to celebrate you in public, darling. I asked to my friends if a card was a good idea, I was ensure how to celebrate you the best I could. I wanted to tell everyone how hard you worked for your PhD, your incredible journey. I started to collate something and as I added more to the story the paper was not enough and so I added more and more… until there was no more blue paper! GDN: Ah ah really? (relieved) It is a great card and I like it very much Mum. M: I am happy you do, thank you. GDN: It was difficult for me to read that story. I don’t feel it is true. I did not construct my maps, I did not read all those books, in fact I cannot read, I don’t have a study method, I am not methodical. I have used suggestions from others, I have copied my supervisors thinking at most, Linden, Laura, Wilma. There is very little of my own thoughts in the thesis and that does not have much academic grounds. Now I start a doctorate! M: That is how everyone learns darling. We don’t learn but by imitating others that we like. You chose your mentors carefully because you like them. I don’t remember anything of all the philosophy I studied in my MA. It is the spiral you talked about in your thesis. You spiral around and you learn a bit more each time. G: Ah ah! Yes I was forgetting that. I have talked about these feelings of inadequacy with my therapist. Many feel inadequate to their titles. Many feel inadequate in general. It helps me to talk about it although it is difficult. I am trying to change many things in my life. M: Maybe you are trying too hard. Don’t ask too much of yourself. Look back at all the way you have come through. In 10 years you’ll have walked just as much and you will look back again. You can celebrate that. Sometime I talk to friends and notice that they are struggling with things that I have understood, whilst other things I haven’t of course. G: Ok. I am sorry I treated you badly. I was trying to change some dynamics between us but I was not clear with you. I need some space. I look forward to doing things together this summer. Could you call me in the evening so that I feel I have more of a working life? M: Ok. And if I call you at another time you can say you are busy, I have no problem with that. GDN: You are right! I can just say I am busy and call you at another time. I get this feeling I have to respond even if I don’t feel like it. I worry about you and grandma. M: Let’s not make confusion here. It is two different things. GDN: Yes. Ok. (I think I am confused about ‘my space’ and ‘other's space’ but am working on it). I was trying to change things without saying it and this was confusing, like Dad did sometime. I will speak more openly. It is so much easier. Such a stupid little thing! M: It is not stupid at all! It takes people all their lives to change these things. Your protests whilst hurtful made me to think. I was doing things I was not convinced with and now I understood why. I won’t tell you but it was important, so something good came from it. GDN: Good. M: Good. GND: So we’ll be in touch. When do you have the results of your exam? M: We’ll go through them on Thursday. GDN: You’ll tell me about it. Take care of yourself. M: And you. Analysis: Mmm mum and I responded to your prompt and got our stories out.

Intense application of the senses and the mind on a certain object (Garzanti Italian Dictionary, 2008, my translation) Thank you Alice for this first prompt. What a start! I can see how the words attention, acceptance, appreciation, affection, and allowing go together. They have to do for me with attending to the other, as well as to oneself. Donald Winnicott in Playing and Reality (1971) has written about being 'reflected back' as a condition that characterizes (adult) relationships with these qualities. Being reflected back creates a potential space that allows creative expression of different parts of oneself, thus of a whole personality that coheres and flourishes in the process. Such thoughts have helped me start looking at my own life and relationships. Of course, loving and playing are difficult and conflicted. I have grown up with a father who gave me little of the above as he was (is?) quite blocked and would not easily allow proximity, whilst idealizing our relationship as open and playful. I myself often struggle to balance between accepting and appreciating others and myself allowing us to become I may instead please others or step back. These five A's remind me of yoga practice and trying to feel through the body what happens to us, taking the time to attend to ourselves in the world, as in this accelerated and mediated times we are drawn to perform, while engaging with our lives is a highly uncertain creative process. Bodywork like movement and dance improvisation for me is offering a way to practice those qualities in relationships with self and other through releasing tensions and staying with affective and cognitive crises.

I had already read your prompt and got very intrigued by Wuthering Highs, red colour, your wonderful performance, the mouths. I searched for hidden red in my life. In my home. Secret spots. I listened to Kate Bush Lily. Loved it. (female David Bowie?) More organic forms started to catch my imagination. Found this song by Italian singer Elisa, Soul flies. She is not a favorite of mine, too romantic stuff and not enough Character. No anger!!!!! No Red Woman for sure. But this one is a bit different… I had not liked 6 months ago and now I like more. Note the evocative resonance with both Kate Bush songs and videos! Now I go out. See you later. Walk I went to the parade Milano Senza Muri it We were around 100000 people, colourful, diverse and loud. It was a huge party! I joined the parade at the start in Porta Venezia, watched it walk, watched untile the coda, then joined the walking until we all reached Parco Sempione behind the Sforzesco Castle. I saw I friend from yoga and famous pianist Ludovico Einaudi (very great!) who is shorter than I imagined and walked unnoticed through the flux of people reminding me of how many of artists go unnoticed and make 'us' in everyday life how many artists in us go unnoticed too? An old friend of mine, Lucia, who lives in Sicily walked in in my arms before we both noticed one another! We were slightly uncomfortable having not been in touch for a long time. I met her again in the park and we spent the evening tougher with another journalist friend chatting about 'narrated journalism' and feminist practice to counter power and oppression / depression. We heard La crus (Mauro Ermanno Giovanardi and Cesare Malfatti, such elegant talented musicians) play in a simple unplugged version (voice + guitar) some songs, among those Un garofano nero. Ermanno tapped with his foot on the wooden stage, we were a few bunch of people by that time, so intimate, he touched us with his smooth dense voice, we swung like serpents, black carnations. sono un garofano neroe assomiglio alla linfa che hoprendimi e macchiatiio sono un garofano neroma non brillo al soleio non ti scaldo con le parolema quando la luna rompe l'incantoio sono perso nell'universo che assomiglia alla linfa che hoio sono un garofano neromacchiato dal dono che hoaprimi e confonditiio sono un garofano neronon ho rancoree ridiscendo con un chiarorema quando la luna rompe l'incantoio sono perso nell'universo che assomiglia al vuoto che hoio sono un garofano neromacchiato dal dono che honon ho rancoretu non confonderti con le paroletu non confondermima quando la luna rompe l'incantoio sono perso nell'universo che assomiglia alla linfa che hoThe day seemed never to want to end. The park was still flooded in warm light as we sat at a stall having chips and almond milk. I left Lucia at the train station and walked back home in the night. My city makes me fall in love. In the springtime it opens up like a dark flower revealing all its sensuality. AfterI had some food as soon as I got home. Sloes, ricotta, and yellow taralli from Puglia which I had all bought in the morning at the market. The woman selling them is going down (South) on Monday to do some work in her land which she showed me a picture of. There was a trullo (traditional stone construction) in her land. I've been wearing this ring today since I found it in the small wooden box in the first picture. My parents brought back all these little jewelry from India when they toured the country together before I was born. My mother sent back books that she would not read. My father stayed three months longer and came back starved having finished money. Today I feel that I went with an open heart and some things came to me without my will, just my openness. Things lost were found. Connections took place. I was surprised by the ease and enjoyed the pleasure. As Laurie Anderson simply put it, the most essential is to fall in love I do not know when I became an adult. I think I am becoming one now. It is something that clicked, a need, a feeling, a change in orientation. What's really important? How do I want to be here as long as I can be here? I have thought about death, my own time, the time of humankind, the uncanny feeling of being here without ever knowing, yet with the capacity to ask the question. I have asked myself what may be the different between noise and being. Where meaning lies. Can I unlearn, can I learn again, can I improvise?","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":16,"midCount":6,"highCount":6,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":304,"file":"gaia responses/Day 21.

She is a woman who meets the world form the inside out and writes about it. Our dialogue would be something around these lines. Scene: Cambridge gardens, 5pm on a Tuesday afternoon in September 2017. The two characters are sitting on the grass and taking tea from a blue porcelain teapot. objects are spread in from of them on a blue shawl. GDN: …and so I put these objects together following a sort of ‘flow’ in my mind, and I still like them. They make some sense together although I cannot say what. The colours speak too, the reds and silvers, and all that blues there in waves. I even found out I had a Great Bear mug ( with a golden constellation from Stoke-on-Trent, that’s what made my buy it you know, Linden’s passion for history and distress in the city) . And you’re there, and (m)others, and that first pig artwork of mine. I dunno what to make of it all. VW: it is or will become a revelation of some order; *GDN: do you think so? VW: it is a token of some real thing behind appearances; and I make it real by putting it into words. *GDN: I know you do. (pause) I think I am trying to. It can be painful to undergo this process though, isn’t it? VW: it is only by putting it into words that I make it whole; this wholeness means that is has lost its power to hurt me; it gives me, perhaps because by doing so I take away the pain, a great delight to put the severed parts together. *GDN: that is so powerful what it happens. I feel a great deal of pleasure right now talking to you. VW: perhaps this is the strongest pleasure known to me. It is the rapture I get when in writing I seem to be discovering what belongs to what. *GDN: yes I get that too. I seem to never know before writing how the frame goes together. Or what is behind the frame, for what matters! VW: have you not read that famous quotation of mine, the ‘behind the cotton wool’ thing? It is so overused in Academia nowadays, like everyone knows what I was talking about. Well, you may have a look at it. But please not take my scribbles too seriously darling, don’t take anyone scribbles too seriously! you need to find your own land, your own words. And not take those too seriously either. GDN: uhm yes OK, thank you Madam. I will check that and keep the rest under check too. It was lovely to take tea with you in Cambridge gardens. Still a bit crowded with young males, but we found our place in the sun. VW: and all these mobile phones and earplugs! The weaves get other meanings in this connectivity time, what ever that means anyway. Enough wisdom for today, I want to walk back to my quiet. Hope you don’t mind. I’ll see you around here soon. Take care of yourself if you can. And she left. I got to the library and found the quotation. Not sure what to do with it but thought I might note it down for future reference:… behind the cotton wool is hidden a pattern; that we I mean all human beings are connected with this; that the whole world is a work of art; that we are parts of the work of art. Hamlet or a Beethoven quartet is the truth about this vast mass that we call the world. But there is no Shakespeare, there is no Beethoven; certainly and emphatically there is no God; we are the words; we are the music; we are the thing itself.

Is that your son in the picture? He is terribly brave and slightly unusual which is a very good thing. Today I went to therapy and we found some very interesting ideas that help me read what I do and some repetitious cycles I got stuck into. I am amazed at how it works. When I bring my own reflections and findings into that room he responds to what I say. Often even just one word gets me on a new line of thought, POP!, I have a new connection, a further step, a different side. Fruitful traction. It leaves me in wonder about the mind as something really extended between people. The winding road in your video makes me think about something a long winding road ago… The other time I went to therapy I was 12 years old. I had found this woman and had met her for some time. Not much was coming out of it. Until I spent most of a session in silence. I was so angry. I came back the following session with a written note. The studio was small with her sitting behind a desk and me on an armchair. I read the text to the woman. The girl in the text was home one night. Her parents shouting from the kitchen, she hiding under her bed. They moved in the corridor. The main door opened. And then she heard her father say from the doorstep ‘That's right but you manage your daughter now’ Oh Alice I took the invitation of our charming Blue Man (how could I not?) and responded with my Wheel of Life… That’s how it feels!

Cautious as neither enthusiastic nor opponent. I would like to learn to position myself at the right distance and at the most satisfying proximity to new media and mediated relationships. I am on Facebook but post or read very little… I find it noisy: there's so much going on at the same time that I get the impression I am missing out on so many conversations, but ironically there's little conversation and a lot of showing off / solipsism. It has a noise effect on myself as I get soaked into scrolling and reading more but with no permanence of what I read no absorbing, to use a word we you and I and participant 14 used before. It is a reactive medium. You like or you fight. I've tried Twitter but am not very good at it yet. Uhm yes I am quite slow with trying technologies, I resist for a long time before realizing I could give it a go and possibly like it… So I do not actively keep in contact with friends through social media neither with an academic community and I am working towards chaining that to be visible on platforms like Academia. edu. I use Whatsapp to message friends and like to add emoticons. I email with colleagues and like it very much for it is clean and storable and gives each other time to process before answering. I don't know what I'll do when I get back to thousands of work emails! Also I've heard that nowadays university students email their professors to ask any sort of thing and most of the time the latter answer. It was not like that in my time (oh gosh!) , and I wonder if we are all regressing into an infantilization of relationships of work and of learning. Writing a digital message can be self protective. Both as scripta manent and so the blaming game sets off, and in relation to your question because there is not the other im-mediately there in her body, look, voice, presence, and our body feeling that. We can say whatever we want. It can be quite a stupid interaction, as it is truncated of its felt sense and felt meaning what we co-create together as meaningful. So on one side I enjoy exchanging written text with people and there's a lot of space for written humour which would not be there otherwise! But then I need to talk as well, face to face if possible, and that cements relationships for me, and evolves them too. With my Participant 8 I exchange emails with links to interesting events, exhibitions, news. We keep a channel open for all intellectual content and have it freed up for our affective relationship. We also know more about one another. Dad instead does not write emails and rarely sends texts so we most of the time speak on the phone. He is a bit of a bear in the mountain, as I told you. Not in a bad sense. He is very emotional. I find pictures taken with the phone and sent via Whatapp an immediate and intimate way to connect. I wrote letters and postcards to lovers and that is special and slightly vintage, and I do that sometimes with friends too. It takes a bit more time and effort and something reaches the other physically and their home, where they live. We visit them. Only when visiting friends's homes we get to know something previously unknown about them and about ourselves and how we can be close together regardless and by reason of our differences… or not.

I had not worn a skirt for months but did today, thanks to your prompt! same with nail polish which I've never learnt to do properly and refuse to pay for. I should signal some synchronicity as I thought about my dresses and skirts just yesterday before reading prompt n. 6! Maybe you will find this interesting… I usually wear jeans. Love them. So practical! The thing is I have the feeling of overdoing when being more feminine. When I was a teenager I did more of that and I do in the summer months summer makes me more feminine. That's because I don't care in the summer. In the winter I don't care in another way: I am not bothered. I like being comfortable with myself. There's a part of me who does not want to invest on looks as there's always something more interesting to think about. Yet I naturally like nice things. I wonder wether I could not care like in the summer in the winter also wear whatever I grab hands on even if I look eye-catching. Questions of the feminine or of the feminist? I read Jessica Valenti's book, Sex object, and found resonance in her ambivalence with getting attention (from men) and being used for lack of a sense of self protection. The feminine is a potent voice in me that asks to be given more space. It scares me. Will I be strong enough to honor it? What will it eradicate in my world? So I make a little more space every day, say no to someone, meet feelings of frustration, go for what gives me the thrills or the peace. I met a men, lover and liar, and we were together for two years. Married with two children always about to divorce.

The process usually results in something more beautiful than the original.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlow","lowCount":11,"midCount":0,"highCount":4,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":323,"file":"gaia noticings/Day 20: Noticings","title":"Day 20: Noticings.","created_date":"2018-02-19 14:10:42","text":"I had not spoken to my mother for a while.

When I started the project I toyed with the idea of calling it ‘Trouble, Traction, Transform’ but I settled on ‘Touch, Traction, Transform’ because ‘Touch' can come in many forms light and dark, heavy and tender… trouble or joy… So tomorrow, Tuesday 23rd, I would like you to list the main moments of ‘Traction’ in your life so far, not just ‘Memories' but actual ’Turning Points’, ‘Aha’ moments… at the threshold between what was and then what is.

Falling off a door top and breaking my ankle in the night on the eve of my 4th Birthday. I remember it dragging along behind me as I went into Mum and Dad’s room but they didn’t believe me until the morning. Mum and Dad won’t always believe me. People are kind. A girl at nursery deliberately knocking my red and green carefully painted plaster of Paris ‘Alice in Wonderland’ chess pieces to the floor and them smashing. Not everyone is kind. I am scared and not able. Leaping off a huge rock three times bigger than me at my Grandparents house in Devon. I am brave and I am able. I need to stay close to the house. Finding a wild cats nest. I can explore. I am not a boy or a girl I am me. Refusing to play with Ian and Alan after Ian told me he loved me when I was only 7. I am a girl. I am unique, adored and special. The birth of my three sisters. I am not unique. I have to share. Adults can always protect me. Getting stuck in a ‘eddy’ whirlwind in a burnt cornfield with my Grandpa ‘Umpa. Grown ups can’t always protect me. I can have anything I want. Being told this was the only shop I could get school shoes from. I can’t have everything I want. Being a good girlHiding my wellie boots in the bushes at the bus stop before school and putting on my Granny’s heeled pixie boots instead. Being a rebel. Sex is bad. Making love to my first boyfriend against my bedroom wall. Sex is good. Be careful. London is full of strangers. Moving from a village in Leicestershire to New Cross in London. Meeting my best friend Sophie and each being given a pink carnation by a stranger as we held each other and cried in Blackheath church homesick and troubled. Strangers can be kind even in London. The world is a dangerous place. Travelling across America on my own at 19years old and ending up in Yosemite park with a German and American and a Bear. I can trust my own instincts and keep myself safe. I am not ‘healed’ enough to be a mother. The birth of my son Barney. I am a ‘good enough’ mother. I cannot possibly love another child like I love my first. The birth of my son Henry. Love is expansive and has no boundaries. I am lost. Sitting on the floor and re-discovering all my sketchbooks and writings from art school and realising that the things I am searching for now, I already worked out or known. ‘The forgotten known’. I am found. Life is unfair. Travelling to Australia to hold my sister and her stillborn daughter Susie my niece. There must be something to learn from each experience however painful. I can get married because my head tells me too. My wedding in New York. A marriage that is not from the heart is not a marriage. You have to stick a marriage out for the sake of the children and everyone else even if you are unhappy inside. I am unimportant. My divorce in Nottingham Crown Court. You can choose to change things however painful and become Happier. I matter. When I went on a long walk last weekend I took lots of photos of bridges, crossings, stiles, and a ford… IMG_2664. movAnd a lot of my ‘transition points’ are also marked by house moves… 'Today I looked over the gate of my ‘old’ family ‘house'. It is set to go on the housing market this week and represents the end of my marriage and the culmination of my divorce. The ultimate social status and achievement of ‘five bedroom quintessential thatched cottage in the heart of Rutland’ has dissolved. Since my divorce, good friends of mine recently said to me that when they first saw this house 3-years ago, they thought, ‘Oh no, Alice and Alex have bought another massive and stressful project to ‘hold’ themselves together’. She couldn't have been more right. In this ‘aha’ moment I allowed myself to ‘admit’ I was living a lie, a false construct that no longer fed my ‘heart’. With a project to focus on the ‘outside’ we didn’t need to look at ‘us’ ‘inside’. With this painful insight I made the choice point to leave, turning insight into action and transit, transform. I now live in a smaller rental property in a market town nearby. But it ‘feels’ like my home. After 18 years of ‘relationship’ I at last had the insight and courage to liberate myself from my self made false constructs of ‘success’ ‘social', ‘relational', ‘economic’ status and fear. I now feel so ‘much' inner freedom and happiness with so much ‘less’. I am starting to experience what it feels like to be really ‘fulfilled’ inside rather than ‘successful’ seen outside. Inside ‘noticings'. Outside ‘trappings'. Freedom, flight, transformation. I have learnt to ‘give my feelings ‘form’ and not ‘form’ to my feelings… I look forward to hearing about your ‘aha’ moments… all gates can be opened. All prison doors have keys… Day 1.

Word. Form. Person. Image. Story. I invite you today to steal some of these words and images and make them your own. Like a magpie… pick out the 'shiny things' that resonate for you… cultivate them, dialogue with them… make them your own… change their shape, colour tone, hue… I want you to take them back into your nest and add to them, reimagine them, rearrange them like ‘furniture'. Place them where you would like them to be. Sit or lay in one of the objects, look down at a view from on high and tell us what you see sea? Breathe in the air what can you smell. Taste the food. What music is playing? What conversations and sounds to you hear? You have never as yet encountered one another except for my loose ‘introductions and mentionings’ in 'group noticings’ so I invite you to meet here in this virtual space and write into the imagined spaces of each others stories expand and contract the in-between: 'rewriting you only meansthat the spaces I'm not writing in are where I live. ’(Mimi Khalvalti, Apology quoted in Day 5) What ‘traction’ points lie between the words below for you? What might your ‘noticing' and 'playfulness' return to the original author? This is your ‘Us’ story: I am 8 years old. Peacocks preen and fight, cars crash outside, a girl and a boy balance on the parapets. A note book lies on Grandfathers sheep skin rug, my toes peeping out of my sandals look as if they have been made out of snow-flakes and drops of sweet evaporated milk. A turntable with an integrated tape deck plays notes through a building with holes for windows, eyes, our first kiss, your tongue thrusting as the florescent light flickers overhead. Stray dogs, skinny and boney, a dead coconut leaf and over there, through the tree, and beyond the swing, I can see the yellow corn. My bed is painted in red with red bars around it. We painted and glued it there. Sometimes that's all any of us need big Bear. Hardly a day passes when I don't think of you. Journeying with the raindrops down the glass, being inside the raindrop perhaps. Talking about the 'strange sound world' that us hard of hearing people inhabit and then acid trip. I went round Times Square, full of hard core 'girlie' mags and film booths with men in dark glasses on high stools behind counters. I was drawn to it, but at the same time I was sick. Red Wellies. Rain Mac. Pompoms and finger-knitting were favourites of mine. The owner of the cafe sexually assaulted me and I didn't tell anybody. Like a dog without a bone. You could just listen, but don't make any judgements. Could you give me a hug, please? Of course. They stand and hold each other for a moment. THINK TRACTION: What part of you do these words touch? Where do they land? What blockages are they signalling? What encounters are they enabling? What action might your words galvanise? What dialogue can we have? And now in any way you wish… images, words, film, sounds… re-write your ‘We’ story out from your bodily responses and places trying feelings first and to not lead with your mind… to know is to feel even if to feel is not yet to know… So. The toes stand out to me snowflakes innocent and pure and sweet, evaporated milk a childlike temptation… Also the items suggest the 70s or even earlier …? 50s-60s? Sheepskin rug, evaporated milk, turntable… Strong sense of place in this. The first line is true for me now, but make that 'hardly an hour'… In time it will fade to 'hardly a day' then 'hardly a week' then 'hardly a month' then 'hardly a year' and maybe then I will have peace… The raindrops. Yes. I know this feeling of being outside oneself suddenly becoming a microcosmSometimes tiny I am a bee supping on ceanothus Sometimes infinite I am the skySometimes travelling through time I am that starSometimes vertiginous I am falling through space Sometimes lost in someone I have left my body and become yours I am the raindrop and the glass. This reminds me of Virginia Woolf and the way she describes the fluidity of boundaries between oneself and others, and objects, and nature. SINCE OUR APPARITIONS, THE PART OF US WHICH APPEARS, ARE SO MOMENTARY COMPARED WITH THE OTHER, THE UNSEEN PART OF US, WHICH SPREADS WIDE, THE UNSEEN MIGHT SURVIVE, BE RECOVERED SOMEHOW ATTACHED TO THIS PERSON OR THAT, OR EVEN HAUNTING CERTAIN PLACES, AFTER DEATH. PERHAPS – PERHAPS. I have this quotation on my 'Blogger, interrupted… ' blog as my header and it expresses for me that fluidity of boundaries, of seen and unseen, shared and hidden, even after death. Possibilities. Perhaps perhaps. What stands out here… The red bed with red bars and the sexual assault never reported. The red reminds me of Margaret Atwood's 'The Handmaid's Tale' .. And Lady Macbeth… Women's blood on their hands, on the bars… How we are imprisoned by our femininity, our sexuality, how our menstrual blood and cycle can define and entrap us.. The red bars on the red bed. I see a girl cycling away fast on a shiny red bike, streamers flying in the wind. I see a girl dancing in a red dress, free from the male gaze. I see a fleck of virginal blood on a sheet. I see red stain on white knickers, the monthly surprise. The blood as the loss… And the gain. The red fleck on the egg as you break it into the frying pan. The secret kept inside our fragile shells don't tell anyone.. But one day someone will break the shell, even ever so gently, and they will see the fleck of blood. Will you be ashamed? Or relieved? Do you want to tell? Or keep your secrets?","mood":"lowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":9,"midCount":9,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"high"},{"id":332,"file":"steph responses/Day 9.

How did you change your mind, and do you think you will be able to keep up with daily correspondence with a doubled number of participants? (She is wise and clearly practiced in these matters… ;) I replied: Good question it is wonderful and very time-consuming… But I think as part of my method and process as the project progresses and the work unfolds that participants will emerge/make themselves know… resulting in around 10 by the start of Phase 2… However and this is wonderful you are all beautifully contributing some in fits and starts some with utter force variations most often due to life circumstances and time…!

You started this thing after all and we participants assist in the gestation of the project. It is a fascinating journey into the unknown. In a sense I follow your lead but I also see my role as co creator.’ and as the ‘mother’ hen of this project I said to Participant 12: 'I feel so touched by your words – they are validating… in a way I realise I feel like a mother needing to get back to my nest of hungry birds and wondering if I am a ‘good enough’ mother… have I let anyone down… did I get back to the nest too late… are some gobbling up the nutrients and getting fatter faster and have I overlooked some quieter less visible ones who need of more nurturing and encouragement’So I’m in anxiety feeling neglectful of some of you who are steaming away with huge powerful ‘traction' but who may now feel neglected as I attend to other more intermittent members of the group and so in all aspects all of us are at risk of losing contact and momentum… lets hang in here! I know inevitably at some point some of you may pull apart as the 'traction breaks’ but I encourage us to each keep trying to engage together in mutual contribution/commitment to our growing relationship… like this image from Participant 12 together we can co-create this space 'in-between’ us but not on our own! :) So finally for those that have done Day 8… here is an extension activity for you… Point Forty Participant 1. mov'Please watch the film above from my last piece ‘Point Forty’ use it as a way of getting into an embodied state before continuing with a piece of ‘What happened’ writing which can either follow on from today's story or be the start a new life narrative from a different time. The film above is a good illustration of how a point of ‘traction’ can facilitate insight what do you think… what do you feel when you watch it and where do you feel these responses/emotions/sensations in your body? And for those that haven’t manage to catch up yet I encourage you to do so if only with 'a few words' and we can expand upon your notes again in time… Many thanks for your patience and your relationship!

(I didn’t fly to Jamaica). The second ’Transformational Growth' took place between August 5th 13. 00 – August 22nd 2am Sykros Island. 5 days later. (I did fly to Greece) This was a ‘Transformational Encounter’. We can choose to how to change and grow. Throughout the previous two years of my Ph. D. research I have worked with all kinds of ‘mobius strips and worlds’ to try and work out where the touch, traction and transformation points are, where I, you, the artwork, audiences enter, exit and move within the work. These existing models are also useful: And this is an ‘art' model of my mobius in action: This is an image of my son ‘falling from the sky’ while the artist mother looks up at the plane he fell from as she simultaneously pilots the plane looking down into her garden from the sky as she stretches out her hand feeling the toy polystyrene plane resting on the grass waiting to take off. It was generated by the artist but packaged by a participant from her last piece ‘Situating the Reciprocal’ and returned to the artist. It is also the mobius strip at work… Another example of looking at Ways of doing it… Way of thinking about it.. And to go back to the start of this post to Participant 5, she went on to stay about technology: If we look at the linguistic origins of the term… cyborgian space, i. e. a space which is extended (functionally, dimensionally, aesthetically) by the intervention of technology. In this sense, it can be imagined as a space we can actually inhabit on a day-to-day basis, albeit a space which somehow amplifies our ‘normal’ way of being… We are cyborgs and that is wonderful. ’Which leads to and leaves us with Bjork and her album/app ‘Biophilia’.

There is a 'dream' transformation list vs a 'fantasy' transformation list…! Okay here's what I know I should do, deep down… Areas to Transform: 1… Replace the fantasy (J) with the dream (writing): sacrifice what you want (will cause pain) for what you need (will bring healing)2… Replace distraction (outer stimulus) with satisfaction (inner stimulation, 'being') 3… Develop concentration (longer) and focus (deeper) introduce intellectual challenge: more reading of more challenging texts4… Instead of chasing short-term thrills, seek long-term fulfilment 5… Maintain health and fitness commitment but without the need for others' approval or to be attractive to men6… Pay attention to and value those around you, appreciate what you have 7… I know I should do all these things, but what if I don't want to? Why, when I'm supposed to be maturing, do I feel selfish and childish again? I want I want. PS I loved the 'magpie' story. If I change my actions, will my thoughts and feelings follow? What happens to unfulfilled desires? Do they simply die? Or are they transformed into creativity, or work, or channelled into other pursuits or existing relationships? Do we have a finite or infinite amount of love to share? Are there limits on the number of valuable emotional connections we can build and nurture? Is it natural selection, pair breeding requirements or social restrictions and conventions that determine the number of lovers or partners we have, whether consecutively or simultaneously, or is there a deeper value to monogamy and exclusivity?","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhigh","lowCount":19,"midCount":13,"highCount":7,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":335,"file":"steph responses/Day 2: Individual noticings","title":"Day 2: Individual noticings.","created_date":"2018-02-19 22:03:21","text":"Boy beards.

Why would you choose them? What would you want to tell or share with them about you or your ‘intimate resources/objects'? What might you want from them?

Touch… As fellow humans, engaging together right now, it doesn’t matter whether ‘we’ are energetically residing in our own male or female, (and potentially states in-between or be-coming) bodies, what we all have in common is that we have all been ‘carried’ within the female womb, body, nest, space… I invite you today to consider re-imagining your residency within your/a/the mothers deep trasnformational womb space. Her body held you for around 9-months in a state of ‘un-gendered being’… a third space, a place of becoming… suspension… before we knew ourselves to be birthed as 'male or female'… Imagine, remember, explore and make present this affective place of feeling… How might it feel to re-experience this place in a metaphorical sense that allows, ‘the other’ [you] to be ‘within me [or another] charged’.

All the senses, including vision, can be regarded as extensions of the sense of touch – as specialisations of the skin. ' (Pallasmaa, J 2012: 42)So much of our life is looking for the ultimate acceptance from parents, but particularly our mothers. I wonder if at some deep-seated level we always resent them for being unable to replicate the security of the womb when we leave their bodies and almost try and punish them for it somehow. What if the patriarchy was built on a huge insecurity, a huge vaccuum always trying to punish women for having the ultimate life giving power, a body with a womb and vagina and vulva that belongs entirely to her, which she has the right to give and share or to reclaim and reclose. Women are reviled for being too sexual, mocked for not being sexual, pitied, ignored when post menopausal. So much of being a woman is about the body and ownership. The dance between mother and daughter is perhaps one of recognition, as we both suffer the same judgments and are both in thrall to the push and pull of the womb and that invisible umbilical cord which connects us to our mothers and our children forever. Sometimes it pulls taut and sometimes it is more relaxed sometimes it is unravelling and sometimes she pulls it, just to make sure she can still get you back. But it can never be cut. We mustn't fight it, I think, but gently hold it, caress it, make sure it doesn't break. It is as fragile as it is strong.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowmidmidhighhighhigh","lowCount":13,"midCount":5,"highCount":6,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":338,"file":"steph responses/Day 18: (Prompt and Response) Transformational Encounters.

Their embodied memory is vast and remembers all the species of flowers they have ever fed on and they ‘know’, when the nectar will be at its fullest… they can also see and hear much much further than humans… So Hummingbirds can fly forwards, backwards, sideways, upside down, straight up, down, hover… they create 75% of their lift on the ‘downstroke’ and 25% of their lift on the ‘upstroke’ they can quickly change direction whether on the up or down stroke… they can utilise the ‘positive' and ‘negative' points of this traction, action to generate decisive change… Today I would like you to imagine yourself as a Hummingbird. What is your Lift? What is your Drag? What is your Thrust? What Grounds you? How do you keep afloat or in flight? What propels you forward? (Your huge heart? Your memory of where to find nourishment? Your ability to adapt? Your ability to change direction and focus on what resources you have within you? Your ability to drop excess baggage?)

In Action Research: 'Action research is about change and intervention.’ (O’Toole, J, 2006: 51). We are using my prompts, (artist/facilitator/muse as Participant 17 has said), to examine how to change a present situation ‘actively’, and to also ‘actively' interrogate our pasts and any 'troublesome situations’ that still reside in body-memory and to excavate the option to creatively and playfully 're-story’ ourselves into positive affect.

This response from Participant 11 You 'like' or you ‘fight' is particularly apt for this next stage of ’Traction’ Days 8 14. As a theme for the next 7 days I invite you to think about ‘Traction’ as a kind of ‘drawing' in… or a ‘pulling' away from… or a drawing away from, or pulling in towards… a kind of ‘adhesive friction’, between one thing, (idea, person, screen/object) and another, (idea, person, screen/object) to potentially ‘connect', ‘correct’, ‘heal’, ‘mend’, ‘overcome’, ‘relocate’ ‘reach out’ ‘pull towards 'a given ‘impetus’ or ‘advancement’ or 'desired result’… This ‘motion or potentially 'e-motion’ is as Participant 9 says often ‘Bittersweet’. Today I invite you to start to explore your own life story by writing down a narrative about an intimate encounter between yourself and another person/object/idea/place etc. that you consider to be at an ‘early' ‘threshold moment’ in your past life. Write it in the first person, like it is a story that you are re-living in this very moment – try to go with what first comes into your head… then write it down from your senses and from your heart. To do this, and as a starting point only, I draw upon the work of Narativ, www. narativ. com . Jane Nash and Dan Milne are practitioner's and contemporaries of mine who use this particular method of storytelling and one which I have experienced with them on several occasions to great affect. One of their principles is that there is a reciprocal relationship between listening and telling. And so I am inviting you to tell and I will listen… from a state of noticing and non judgement. I invite you to use their ‘What Happened’ method telling your story by sticking to ‘What Happened?’ as distinct from giving: OpinionsJudgementsInterpretationsCommentaryand resisting a description of internal processes, so avoid: I thoughtI feltI decidedI realisedetc. Instead use the idea of a ‘sensory camera’ What did you hear, see, taste, smell, touch in your ’threshold’ moment/story/event? e. g. 'It is London 1976. I am five years old. I am standing in a small school hall. I have patent leather sandals on my feet. The room smells of plasticine and cooked liver. Muffled voices are coming out from behind the coats that hang haphazardly on hooks by the blue door with a wire window it's centre. My hands are clammy.

Where are the turning point/s? (Narativ) What Happened Last Line. POINTS OF TRACTION (Alice T-C)I look forward to hearing and feeling your stories… 😃 FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE MORE BACKGROUND AND THEORY/PROMPTS see below: Participant 9 went on to say: 'I sat on the train, I looked around and I am not exaggerating, every single person in the carriage had their head down either on a laptop, iPad or phone. Some people had headphones on, some were texting away, some talking and all were in their own little world. I did not have any eye contact from anyone. I felt excluded and alone. That sense of being excluded made me want to reach for my phone and I realised I was only wanting to do so because I felt alone. I wanted to 'connect' with someone, something of interest. I felt a different sense of aloneness sitting there on a train full of people. Attention was elsewhere. It was focused in and out via digital devices. It was not in the immediate space, environment around the people. I do it myself and I know that I am cutting off and going somewhere more comfortable.’ (Participant 9). Many of you also mentioned ‘Trump’: 'Trump is nothing but fake peddling fake news, and yet the residents of the most powerful Country in the world has put their faith in him, (well just under half of them in actual fact)!’ (Participant 13). As I was starting to write this yesterday, 15th May 2017, I also happened to listened upon the attached radio programme. It was called ‘Truth’ Post-Truth and Revolution… StartTheWeek-20170515-PostTruthAndRevolution. mp3To summarise the debate: The speakers talked of 'emotional narratives with more powerful resonances than hard facts'. That our new technologies have a semblance of 'voracity and viral power’, and that depending on the ‘impetus’ or ‘desired result’ can give ‘certain lies… certain traction at certain times.’ So with such fertile ground for 'blaming someone for something’ their is a collapse of 'possibility and potentiality’ bought about through a disbelief in ‘political' agency (truth/facts) and the replacement of ‘personal' agency (celebrity/emotion) a symptom rather than a cause of our times… With emotional resonance overtaking facts, the algorithms that drive social media rocket boost this tendency to feed us with things ‘certain lies’ that we 'feel already’, feeding us dis-information across a network of friends and family who we trust and we forget to be critical of each other… 'We live in an echo chamber – we hear things we want to hear… ’So what we are doing today is perhaps starting to look at how we can create an emotional narrative that brings 'credibility into our ecosystems' – ways to debunk the post-truths by using emotion not as a short cut to sustaining ‘old power systems’ but to 'research new and innovative ways' of challenging our existing hegemony, by bring a variety of voices, giving greater context to feelings and subjective ‘truths’ plural and perhaps seeking to help us think more critically and affect each other more deeply? Trumps ‘heart’ drove the bombing on Syria… not rationality. This is what happens with ‘viral’ emotion in the wrong hands… It is 'Intimately ‘rational’ to distrust our institutions… we need to recognise the power structures behind the viral ’truths’ – there is not one truth. This is Our times… what emotional narratives to we want to resonate that counter ‘certain lies’ with ‘certain truths’ many subjectivities… many voices, many potentialities, many choices… X I watched their car pull away. Excitedly I went to put on my best (only) pretty set of matching underwear. I was 15. He was 19. He was at university. Well, a poly… It was before mobile phones and emails. We had met in the pub, exchanged addresses how quaint! and started writing letters. He told me my skin was like alabaster. We had nicknames for each other from Winnie the Pooh. His name was Chris. I don't even know if I was attracted to him as I understand attraction now. I romanticised him. Shortly after they had left, his car pulled up. The underwear was cream lace: not soft but quite hard and ridged. The bra was underwired and was also lacy, with a satin panel between the breasts with two small satin buttons. I remember the condom packet was aesthetically unappealing: 80s black, red and grey colour scheme. The packet was black, with a grey central panel featuring a red sports car and diagonal stripes behind it. I think the name of the condoms was Arouser. I can vividly picture the underwear set and that packet far more so than his face or his body. I was excited that I was about to 'do it' but I don't remember being aroused. It was slightly uncomfortable but it didn't hurt. There was a little bit of blood. I washed myself and my knickers afterwards. He left. I looked in the mirror to see if I looked any different and whether people would be able to tell. My parents didn't seem to when they came home. I told my friends the next day at school that is done it. I didn't hear from him again. Later I would wish I had waited for my first proper boyfriend, who I had fun with and was so much more attracted to. But it was like a job that needed doing. Chris got it out of the way.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":15,"midCount":6,"highCount":6,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":341,"file":"steph responses/Day 14.

Prompted by the events of the Manchester Bombings today 😔… as a’ species’ we have also seemingly coerced ‘love' into separate waring factions of religion, power, conflict and division. A participant from my last piece, ‘Situating the Reciprocal’ said of his experience within this artwork, 'If it is a unique contribution to knowledge, then it is a unique contribution to our understanding of love.’ (‘SITUATING THE RECIPROCAL’, MR: 2016). And today perhaps of all days in the UK since July 7 2005 it seems to me ever more important to ‘map a field of connections and love’ and not ‘build barriers and walls of division and hate’. This TETTT work we are doing is important not just to academia and art but hopefully to us, our ‘species’ and planet. By our really listening and wanting to ‘hear’ each other and connect through and beyond our differences… we surely make small steps away from ‘hate' and towards a more hopeful, restorative and unique contribution to ‘love’. Stephanie Hunter. Natal Chart Report St. pdfSo I have noticed over the past fortnight your many different ‘mappings’ of love, journeying, connection, touch, movement, out, back, between, within, beyond to include yesterday your own personal maps of connections, familial, romantic, collegial and other… Today, as a bit of ‘fun’ and in order for me to practically ‘collect’ your data, I have mapped your birth chart for each of you. This 'natal chart’, is a picture of ‘your' sky at the exact time of your birth showing where the planets were in relation to the earth and the zodiac when you were born. These charts create interesting ‘shapes’ and if you wish to draw anything more from them in terms of the ‘meaning of the positions’, on your 'temperament, patterns of behaviour, general characteristics' and the 'potential influences’ the planetary positioning might have on your life then please do so. If this is the case I suggest you look at the chart diagram, maybe reading the blurb on the PDF also and noticing what leaps out at you in relation to your own 14 days of mapping your experiences of ‘Touch’ and ‘Traction’ response. Are there any further useful traction points of cross-reference, resonance and resource in relation to your birth skies that might be worth recording? What seems to align? What seems untrue? What insights/resistances offer traction? Any more ‘aha’ moments in image, word, thought, sense, action, colour, sound, hue? What intimacy, ‘in-to-me-i-see’ to you see when your 'sky and earth’, or your 'you and I' collide? This is mine: For example in mine these are the useful ‘planetary’ musings that for me seem to some how correlate with my own ‘earthly’ experiences and reflections: Perhaps the early family life was lacking in supervision or clearly defined rules. A father figure may have been absent or distant and ineffective. You may have a glorified image of your father. Whether the image is very positive or very negative (or if it swings between these extremes), the image is not very clear or rational. Whatever the case may be, you struggle with defining who you are. You might be susceptible to being taken advantage of by others, especially by men or authority figures. You may be easily led astray by peculiar desires or self-destructive habits. You may struggle with early conditioning that made you feel tossed aside or neglected in some way, and certainly not directed or supported. You are not much scared of anything. You enjoy and embrace growth, especially of the psychological kind. You look for symbols, and read between the lines in most any situation. You are not afraid to get your hands dirty, and you are usually quick to help others--not only with mundane tasks, but also on a spiritual or psychological level. You are not a do-gooder nor are you a law-breaker. However, you are not afraid of the dark side of human nature, and you will bend the rules from time to time if you feel the need to do so. You take particular pleasure in growth and life's lessons. You are not fond of superficiality, and are generally the first to spot pretense of any kind. You are passionate and can be intense. Highly imaginative. She fantasizes frequently. She falls back into her imaginary world. Dreamlike. Your imagination is so powerful that it can be hard to trust your instincts. You easily imagine things going wrong, just as you easily fantasize about good things! You are usually found chasing a dream… or a fantasy. The former is probably the better path. You are very responsive, communicative, and curious. She likes research, investigations, inquiries. Studies well. She is fascinated with all that is unexplored, mysterious, taboo, secret, and psychological. Loves research and has a great mind. She wants to know the motivation behind what people do. Her senses lead. It is only when you get into touch with your heart and discover your true desires that you realize that sensations are merely sensations--not deeply satisfying or fulfilling. Sometimes prone to feelings of guilt about their anger, and difficulties with asserting themselves, Mars in Pisces individuals seem to go with the flow. As you have difficulty trusting in your ability to go after things that you want in a direct manner. It may also be that you have difficulty pinpointing what it is that you want, or that part of you doesn't feel you deserve it due to a basic lack of self-confidence. You fear rejection as well as criticism, and often use roundabout means to go after what you want. If you do feel resentment for giving up your power to someone else, learn to avoid giving it up unless you truly understand that you are doing it for yourself, and not for someone else. Adopting a more direct and assertive approach to life is something that you should be working towards. Values people and personal freedom most. Wants to show unique perspective or skills. Open to new methods and progress. Crafty, subtle and critical. Great tolerance and humanitarianism. She knows what's going on at a glance. She thirsts after knowledge, and is a good organizer. She is very independent, likes her freedom of action, is a non-conformist. Possesses a serious mind, sometimes wishing to be more free and breezy. Pluto represents transformations, mutations and elimination. They have charming smiles, a gentle approach with others, and an easygoing image. She will study for a long time, will be erudite. Very intelligent, an open and independent spirit, will have a connection with foreign countries. Fertile intelligence. She will leave the family home reasonably young. Likes liberty, wants a life that is out-of-the-ordinary, and certainly one that does not correspond with Mum and Dad’s. Likes studying, is open to anything new, accepts and recognizes her errors, always develops in a positive sense. Likes travel, discovery, meeting new people and knows how to appreciate them. All the leadership qualities are there: authority, sense of organization, initiative, intelligence, but also thanks to outside help. She is a fighter. Her knowledge is the result of study but also of the down-to-earth nature that characterizes her. Marriage doesn't bring luck, honors come as she imagined they might. These are the areas which stood out for me from the natal chart… I feel these weaknesses, especially vanity, coming out in my 40s. I can be proud, vain, arrogant and presumptuous but I don't look down on others and I can also be humble definitely look for the good and respect the skills and achievements of others. Possibly let myself off the hook a little more as I get older… sometimes this is a good thing, a 'letting go' of unreasonable expectations by self or others… sometimes it may be a weakness allowing myself to pursue the wrong path due to a moral weakness? I would still love to travel and even work abroad… I feel I have more long haul travel in me… will plan this with family but also yearn for the taking off and backpacking solo days. Will they come again? The restlessness speaks to me. I like stability, security and routine but also crave novelty and stimulation. I like excitement, intensity, drama and high emotional states. I think the warning about 'the grass is greener' applies to me and usually head rules heart here… Yes I attract change and disruption and desire yet fear it. Am I subconsciously or consciously attracting this disruption and what do I hope to provoke? Yes I have attracted a partner with a hot temper and deep emotions who is seeking his own deeper fulfilment and creative realisation. He shows his love in many everyday and practical ways… and I know the value of these… but perhaps the drama queen in me wants huge gestures, romantic gifts, extravagant compliments. Do I want to provoke a reaction? A declaration? A conflict? A duel? I want Heathcliff over Darcy every time. Maybe some kind of medieval knight / princess fairytale issue going on !! Power & independence vs powerlessness and being rescued. I don't think I come across as distant ? But do perhaps have a need to be appreciated which makes me superficial? I don't think that 'marriage is not for me' but have always thought I'd be equally happy single. If I hadn't married I would have been sad not to be a mother but think I would have still had a fulfilling creative life. I am easily seduced by the new and exciting which may make me a bit shallow? I am quite practical and logical on the surface but spend a lot of time in my imagination. Chasing the dream and not the fantasy seems good advice!! Interesting here that 'too great an independence' may not be good for me. I agree I need checks and balances, a sensible partner or boss against whom I can 'rebel' or challenge, but who I know is a good guide and mentor that can keep me on track and act as my moral compass when I may be a little shaky, distracted or tempted I need to spread my wings but I like to come back to the nest. I may give out mixed signals I'm fiercely independent but I like to be looked after. I'm a feminist who sometimes wants a caveman or a knight in shining armour. I want to be alone but crave attention and feedback. The thought that's bothering me today is Do I pretend to be a nice person but really I'm not that nice at all? Do I give out mixed signals? Saw this in a friend's gift shop and it seemed like a personal message rather than a label for a section of cards…","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":25,"midCount":9,"highCount":14,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":342,"file":"steph responses/Day 16:  (Prompt and Response) Transformational Encounters.

I don't know how to save them into this Day. I heard the song at the Manchester One Love concert after the bombing and it was the perfect timing. That night, after I heard 'Fix You', I had this dream (see picture) it was a really vivid dream, one where you wake up and think it has happened. It seemed like the building from Lego was the concrete representation of the dream or fantasy I wanted him to build for me. The building, the fixing, joined together, all seemed symbolic. Both external though, and perhaps male giving up agency to a male narrative of 'fixing' problems or 'building' or perhaps trying to turn my 'castle in the air' into something concrete yet still a toy, so perhaps suggesting a childish fantasy? and one made of Lego so that can be deconstructed, suggesting it can be easily dismantled or destroyed and turned into something else? Certainly seems to do with play, escapism and fantasy. Very Alice-like too, with the ability to shrink and disappear into the Lego world to go and play. What do you think? What layers have you have shed…? (What were you fed as a child? (Touch)I have shed the need to finish a plate of food if I am not hungry. I have shed the need to please people in authority and get the 'right' answer. My favourite dinner was tuna fish casseroleI never really enjoyed eating meat unless it was spaghetti bologneseWhen I ate a roast dinner I would eat the vegetables first, then the potatoes, then the Yorkshire puddings (best for last) and try to get away with not eating the meatI remember being offended that I had a smaller plate than the adults as if they were trying to fool me by giving me a full plate that I was having as much as themMy dad ate so fast dinner times felt like a competition sometimesWhat did you learn as a teenager. (Traction)? That making my own choices was seen as being difficult, for example going vegetarian, even when I had left homeThat lying rather than having confrontations about potentially unacceptable or transgressive behaviour was easier than telling the truth and a tacit acknowledgment of unknown infringements was more acceptable than sharing the gory detailsThat the path to adulthood was secret, hidden, private when it came to drinking, drugs and sex What remains in your muscle memory, that you silently rehearse?

It's not restful, it feels like nothing is resting, unless my brain becomes too tired to think and then I am just blanking. What worries me sometimes is that I'm in a state of limbo, waiting for something to happen, keeping busy, putting one day in front of the other, filling my time, passing the days, looking to the external, somehow existing passively rather than activating the 'switch' inside that will allow me to move from this state of inertia. What is in this your ‘secret dwelling place’ now? I don't know. Maybe a Lego fairground someone has made for me?

Mum is right. If I can’t change my life or my inner world I change my hair. Thankfully for a few years now the balance has tipped from ‘exterior’ to more ‘interior’ world change and my hair is pretty ‘normal’ now. My ‘alarm’ signals are less ‘performed’ and my world is reconfiguring ‘inside out’ rather than ‘outside in’. As we are all sharing in this journey not all ‘touch’ or ‘encounters’, or ‘emotions’ or ‘relationships’ are ‘nice’. Some ‘aha’ moments come from places of deep discord, disharmony and trauma. In 2015 I met a man that changed my life. He woke me up – I left my marriage (a relationship of 18 years) and I flew the nest. With the man I met I felt ‘alive’. Unfortunately, the man was not just my lover, but my liar. However, I still very much value that encounter. Why? Because he enabled me to see my own long lie and I left my marriage to live my truth. In my 2-year encounter with this he also taught me how to get back into my ‘feminine’. I realised I had arguably been living a ‘male’ and ‘maternal’ role in an unhappy marriage. My encounter with the masculine aspects of this man, allowed me to allow my own more feminine aspects to re-emerge. I put hair extensions in my hair, I took my own room and painted it ‘pink’, I dressed more ‘girlie’, I ‘tried on’ the feminine. This outside display allowed my inner world to reform. Reintegrate. Rebalance myself. After only 6 weeks I repainted the room back to white, but my inner feminine had rehomed herself inside me. I was never going to leave her again so I took her with me and we flew together. I invite you today to ‘try on your inner feminine’ what does it feel like? What does it mean? Whether we are residing in male or female bodies we live in Trump’s anti –feminine world, May’s anti feminine aspect. Where does your inner feminine reside. Does she need some love? Love that you can share with our world to change it? For those of you who like a bit of theory here is some, for those of you that don’t – go and sit in your wardrobe amongst the clothes, your clothes, your partner’s clothes, wrap yourself up in your favourite chair, spend all day in bed nesting cuddling your feminine self or a desiring and desirous object. Nurture your inner feminine today in all it multiple aspects. Let her surface, speak, become known. What does she say? ‘It is acknowledged that gender, determined by different genitalia, remains synonymous with female oppression. Much feminist discourse and subsequent queer studies therefore disclaim any return to this biological binary, seeing notions of essential self as mythical and gender/sex positions as instead socially and culturally constructed (Butler, 1990 & 1993) . Conversely, French feminist Cixous, reclaims the biological female body and associated femininities as source of celebration and liberation. Cixous names this process ecriture feminine, a method of female writing from deep within the body. Cixous proposes that all genders and sexualities can appropriate ecriture feminine, within a third space, ‘each one’s location in self… of the presence – variously manifest and insistent according to each person, male or female – of both sexes’ (Cixous 1976 in Marks and De Courtivron 1981b: 254). Indeed, her concept of an awareness of a presence within the self, of both sexes, to the ‘non exclusion either of the difference, or of one sex… [this] ‘self permission’, gives all bodies the potential to feel with multiplicity. (Cixous 1976 in Marks and De Courtivron 1981: 254) The Oedipus myth, normalised as representative of the entire human condition, only refers to father/son, mother/son relationships. It denies any matrilineal relationship of women connected to mothers, sisters and daughters or any suggestion of father/son, father/mother relationships that allow for a female jouissance within and between male bodies also. Roselind Gill (2007) refers to this as adopting a ‘feminine sensibility’. Where might adopting a ‘feminine sensibility’ perhaps help us reform our selves and our world in a different way gently but fiercely challenging, political, cultural and social governance from the inside out? Alice XFemininity or feminism for me is building the inner and outer strength to truly own my own body and mind, to choose how to use both for my authentic purpose, or for fun and enjoyment, and not to fear the judgement or mockery of others in doing so, even if I do not fit into patriarchal or societal norms or paradigms. 😘","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowmidhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":15,"midCount":5,"highCount":5,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":345,"file":"steph responses/Day 1.

Have you experienced their opposites… Feel free to respond in anyway that moves you. LOVE. Alice. Am I giving myself the attention back which I have given to raising my children for ten years in a healthy way? As something nurturing, involving healthy food and exercise and time for reading, writing, art, cinema, theatre and seeing friends? Or am I seeing attention for something I fear I am losing? As the latter suggests an immaturity and insecurity rather than a mature coming back to self… I know I am loved and accepted by my family and friends. What is it I seek outside of this? I am fulfilled in my work and relationships. So why the attraction to social media? I have already left Facebook but simply replaced it (albeit on a smaller platform) on Instagram. Do I seek some form of external validation or public recognition and if so, why? Should I not be able to find this peace and acceptance within myself and my immediate circle of love? Is the fear of ageing making me childishly seek attention? Am I advertising to myself or others? Contributing to a 'healthy' narrative advertising my health and fitness in images online, as I focus on physical maintenance while emotionally I may struggle more to come to terms with the slow irrevocable process of ageing… Buying anti ageing products then pissing myself laughing when they arrive 😂😂 yet still using them anyway 🙈Or by engaging online, am I trying to connect with the world the way it now is? As another part of ageing is being left out or left behind as the younger generations move on to new forms of communication or bonding. There is a drift away from face to face connection, a strange dislocation from the voice everything typed onto a screen, considered before it is presented. Then again there is FaceTime but again it's about visual presentation. I like a voice call but only talk on the phone to a handful of my closest family and friends now. I suspect there will be some form of withdrawal from public sharing soon in general and among the younger generation and for me. I think also for me a retreat to the safer, kinder forum of smaller friendship groups on WhatsApp and/or the one to one connections of higher value than the superficial value of the wider crowd appreciation perhaps this is the process I am going through now. And perhaps to be truthful I think some of it is a kind of sexual advertising an 'am I still hot' signal as my desirability fades. Perhaps there is time for one last appreciation before invisibility… And that way danger lies! This by Rebecca Solnit encapsulates much of how I feel about how technology affects the purity and sanctity of the human attention, acceptance and appreciation of self and others. We are so distracted all the time that we are not truly present with others or even ourselves much of the time.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmid","lowCount":14,"midCount":5,"highCount":4,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":346,"file":"steph responses/Day 12.

''Does it happen all at once, like being wound up, ' he asked, 'or bit by bit? ''It doesn't happen all at once, ' said the Skin Horse. 'You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.

I’ve used mindfulness techniques for a long time, but my favourite was always to look up at the buildings and find shapes and patterns I liked but that doesn’t work so well now I’m out of London no big buildings. Conversely, anxiety is one of the biggest drivers in my life. When I can rein it in to a manageable level, it gives me just enough nervous tension to be really effective and to keep pushing through in difficult situations. I haven’t altogether managed to figure out how to keep it at this level though. My friends keep me grounded and my family cocoon me. I really really love my close friends. They are really different to each other (and to me) but they are all amazing, strong women who have been through a lot. I love our differences, they let me touch base with the ‘real’ world. All my close friends are also very upfront and honest, which is not what I experienced in my childhood relationships so I value it enormously now.

I invite you to complete the following sentences as you feel moved to: I never touch… my best friendsI like to touch… things that are solid and won't give way, my son’s chubby feet, my husbands hands I love hands! I am completely in touch with… my little boy, Ernest. I have felt touched by… seeing people in the migrant/refugee camps across Europe, especially families. I think this is heightened by the fact that I have such a young child myself and I feel so conscious of the effort to create an environment that is soft, warm, open and safe for him, so when I see these shacks and tents with the water leaking in and other people so close it makes me afraid for them. I wish I had touched… I don't really have many regrets, I’m pretty at ease with the past it’s the future that makes me nervous! So I can't really think of something I wish I had done differently like this. I like being touched on… depends who is doing the touching! I swear I never touched… class A drugs! I’ve always had intermittent phases of time when I am been brimming over with nervous energy (I always used to be the last one standing on the dance floor) and this has often been credited to some kind of chemical intervention, but no! I was even incorrectly diagnosed as bipolar because the swings used to be so extreme I’m a bit more balanced these days. I left a mark on… my first really serious boyfriend. I cheated on him many years ago and staying friends after we eventually broke up was just too complicated. I moved on pretty quickly but he still occasionally (10 years later) resurfaces and tries to make contact, but it always gets weird and bitter because he still gets very jealous. He has a wife and baby and I don’t doubt that he adores them, but I think he is still hurt by me and feels some need to fix that. I am touched every time… Ernest hugs me. It makes my heart actually ache. I like to touch base by… cooking a meal for/with a friend. I like to touch base with… my oldest friends, all people I didn’t expect to be friends with when I met them! They are all over the world now so I don’t get the chance too often. The past touches me like… it’s squeezing my heart ever so gently How much am I in touch with me? Getting a little closer all the time, but I am constantly surprised by how little I know myself and how changeable I am. If I sit quietly for a while making something with my hands, I feel quite in touch with myself but there are not many opportunities for that. Can I see your hands?

Peter (my husband) I’ll send him a hand-drawn invitation so he knows it’s different to a normal meal! I know he’s a bit of an obvious choice but I don’t think we’ve had a special meal together for months and 8th June is our wedding anniversary so we have booked a babysitter. This is such a good idea Alice, we were going to go out for dinner but maybe we can have a picnic on the beach instead! :) What ingredients will you choose? Oysters, crab, whelks, rye bread, salad, strawberries and ice cream and WINEWhere will you buy them from? Food is really our thing and we are a bit obsessive about buying locally sourced food because it’s sustainable and tastes better. We used to run a gourmet pie company together and know all the local farmers and suppliers so I’ll get all the seafood from Folkestone Trawlers (they do the best whelks in the world most of them get exported to Korea where they are considered a extravagant delicacy like caviar!), the bread from our local bakers (Dockers) and salad and strawberries from our friend Steve Parsley at Walmestone Growers. We have a special bottle of wine in the cupboard that we got a couple of months ago and decided to save for our anniversary, so we’ll have that and probably some beers from the new trendy beer shop in Folkestone. How will you prepare them? With homemade mayonnaise and shallot vinegar, thrown in a basket and laid out on a cloth on the beach, without a thought for the the day's politics (n. b. we will vote first!) What do you want to gift to your guest? Time and space! Peter normally only gets the bits of my day that are leftover when everything else is done and we both give up space to Ernest and Oakley (the dog) who won’t even let us sit next to each other on the sofa (he squeezes in between us). Where will you eat? On the beach probably Sunny Sands, you can see France from there on a clear day! What will you wear? BRIGHT COLOURS. I’m never quite sure if I dress to reflect my mood or the other way around… What would you like to receive? Just him (Peter) without any stress on his mind and with minimal pain (he has arthritis) would be goodWhat anxieties do you have about how they might receive you? Not many, I’m at my most relaxed with Peter. But sometimes when we relax together for the first time in a while we end up bickering and I hope that doesn’t happenWhat risks can you take? Not sure about this one I think I’ve taken this whole thing in a bit of a boring route for you! I don’t really think about taking risks with Peter, I think we take lots of risks together or in our work, but not much feels risky within the context of our relationship. How dull of us! What is the worse thing that could happen? Rain or an argument! What is the BEST? FOOD, WINE, BRIGHT COLOURS, THE SEA and actually having a conversation with my husband that isn’t about scheduling or childcare! How can you make this a truly transformational encounter? By making the most of the time and space and by asking and listening a lot. We need to talk seriously about the possibility of leaving the country if the Tories get in again (so much for without a thought for politics!!), so that could be a very transformational conversation.

I read your prompt when you sent it through and I thought, oh, that's a shame. I don't have much to say about astrology except that I've never seen much more in it than a series of coincidences and guesswork. But the very next day I met up with some fairly new friends and (without any prompts from me) talk turned quickly to natal charts and star signs. You're not a REAL Leo!  Said my friend Lucy she is also a Leo, but is loud and outgoing and all the things a Leo is supposed to be. You don't even like being the centre of attention. Meanwhile, another friend, Bean, had just had natal charts prepared for all her family as a celebratory gift. I was riled and intrigued so I came back to this. I was especially interested by this quote about Lunar Taureans: They feel with their senses and they are pretty much rooted in their ways. They revel inmaterial comforts--in fact, building a solid and comfortable home and foundation helpsto keep them feeling safe and content. It isn't wise to try to push Lunar Taureans into doing anything, but once they havemade a commitment, they're persevering. There's a steadiness to this position of the Moon that is comforting to those close to them. But the conservative streak in these natives can be maddening to more progressive personalities. They tend to go out of their way to avoid messy or unpredictable situations, crises, and emotional displays. Instead, they focus on creating a reliable and secure life around them. Yep, that's me. Totally failing to find that reliability and security though!! I also realised that I shouldn't be so quick to dismiss this stuff given that I'm so interested in the space between and around us all.

My dad once took me to the Tate Gallery and afterwards we went to an amazing sandwich shop in Pimlico. This was before the days of Pret A Manger and sandwich shops were not a ‘thing’. I chose the most luxurious thing on the menu, a prawn and avocado sandwich on white bread. I remember exactly how it tasted and felt. The bread was thick and crusty and there was loads of butter and mayonnaise. I had salt and pepper too which seemed like such an extravagance for a sandwich. After that, I asked for prawn and avocado sandwiches for my birthday meal every year. We were usually on our annual family sailing trip for my birthday, so eating these morsels of heaven whilst crammed around a table below deck on an army yacht is my major birthday memory.

I’ve been pondering them all day and my overwhelming response is how lucky I am. All of these ‘A’s are heaped on me by my lovely family (almost) all of the time and I try very hard to give back just as much to them. BUT I have a selfish little nag that perhaps I could be appreciated MORE and that acceptance is a very bloody difficult path that we aren’t always doing the best job of navigating. Less selfishly perhaps, I also slip into self-criticism and wonder if I am as generous with the rest of the world. I’m definitely not. The biggest struggle though is whether I am able to apply these things to myself and I am confident that the answer to that is a resolute no. I think I can add another ‘A' to the mix that I am particularly brilliant at. It’s probably at the heart of why I’m not very good at the others. ANXIETY.

There was so much in your prompt but none of it was a question. So I read it over and over again and eventually I figured out what it was that was resonating with me and it comes back to space and the making of it again. I think I was mostly when you said That in fact ‘that this is where it happens’ not ‘in’ us but ‘between’ us. it reminded me of something I wrote about ten years ago. I still love this quote from Diller and Scofidio, because it defined for me why I am so obsessed with the ‘liveness’ of space: [architecture is] everything that happens between one body and another this is further explained by the brilliant Bernard Tschumi Bodies carve all sorts of new and unexpected spaces, through fluid or erratic motions. Architecture, then, is only an organism passively engaged in constant intercourse with users, whose bodies rush against the carefully established rules of architectural thought (Tschumi 2004). Later in the same paper, I wrote this: More than this, architecture can manufacture space into a receptacle for dreams and memories, an external manifestation of our inner beings, a symbol of security. Gaston Bachelard describes the house and the room as psychological diagrams that guide writers and poets in their analysis of intimacy (Bachelard 1994, p38) and Anthony Vidler talks of Poe’s House of Usher as a repository for centuries of memory (Vidler 1994, p18). We can see, therefore that through the ongoing process of human intervention, space can have a history and be experienced in narrative and emotional terms. This ties up so much of the stuff I’ve been saying about touch (and thank you for making me think about this again, because I think it is helping me with my work too!) I feel like the negotiation of the space between one body and another is fraught with emotion and intimacy, so it’s not something I do lightly. In fact it is more fraught if the body i am interacting with is that of someone I care about because there is more history and memory in that space between.","mood":"lowlowlow","lowCount":7,"midCount":2,"highCount":0,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":372,"file":"cherry responses/Day 9.

This is the quickest model I’ve ever made and I really enjoyed the speed. I normally obsess over the details and spend weeks on them, so this was a very happy, healthy exercise! (It’s not finished)In response to your questions about nesting. I think I’m a pretty good nester because I have moved house more than 30 times in my lifetime (I’m 35), so I’ve got it down to a fine art. Actually I find it very therapeutic to pack up a home (lots of lovely cardboard boxes), sort through all our stuff, throw a few things out and reinstall it somewhere new. I don’t get nostalgic about the place I’m leaving. The key for me is unpacking my books and hanging paintings, once that is done I feel at home we don’t travel light unfortunately, so the process can take a while. I find it quite an effort to stay in touch with friends from previous parts of life because I do enjoy the moving on and cutting ties with the past. Over the years, though, I have learned the values of that other sense of home (or nest?) where you are surrounded by a circle of people who are familiar and loved, who you don’t need to work hard to be around, so I do make a conscious effort to maintain those relationships. Nesting is then, I suppose, about creating an environment of familiarity and ease in an otherwise strange and frantic world. The sense of touch is an interesting thing because it feels very intimate to me I’m not much of a hugger outside of my little family. But I rely on my hands such a lot in terms of how i explore materials and spaces and this is so much a part of what I do, so that feels quite intimate too, in a welcome way. I know what every paper type feels like and most paint/varnish finishes, I can recall exactly how the concrete at the Barbican feels in relation to the concrete at the Royal Festival Hall or the stone at Salisbury Cathedral. I prefer that to the feeling of skin! That said, the perfect nest within a nest is a full family cuddle on the sofa at home me, Peter (my husband), Ernest (our son) and Oakley (the dog).

I didn’t read the prompt for this before writing my previous responses and yet that Masters research I told you about on Day 5 was actually about virtuality and the performance of cyberspace. It kicked off a long period of practice when I was working with group of performers online, who I never met until after our collaboration, but with whom I am still good friends. Here’s a paragraph from my research paper which has guided my thinking and practice for many years: As humans, we have a tendency to separate ourselves from technology, seeing it as somehow unnatural and therefore other. But cyberspace is not separate or different to human space. Cyberspace, as imagined by William Gibson, is a concept inspired by the advent of the internet, but not limited to it. In fact, it is more a part of our everyday lives than many of us would imagine. If we look at the linguistic origins of the term cyberspace we can understand it as an abbreviation of cybernetic space, cybernetics being the study of communication and control. We can also think of it as cyborgian space, i. e. a space which is extended (functionally, dimensionally, aesthetically) by the intervention of technology. In this sense, it can be imagined as a space we can actually inhabit on a day-to-day basis, albeit a space which somehow amplifies our ‘normal’ way of being. So then: How would you describe the intimacy and value of your ‘mediated’ relationships, (virtual rather than physical representations and embodiments of yourself/other) through your mobile/i-pad/laptop/desktop/watch/other? I don’t consider these relationships to be ‘mediated’. I consider the relationship to be as ‘real’ and valid whether it is realised in physical or cyber space. Proximal interaction has it’s own barriers and challenges for me I am not brilliant at reading facial expressions/body language and I have auditory processing disorder (a. k. a. cocktail party deafness) which makes it even more difficult to process the information I am receiving in real situations. In virtual environments, I have more space to respond and clearer information to work with I don’t have to work so hard to decipher what is going on. Even without these specific challenges though, I do dispute the idea that social media platforms (etc) prevent valid interaction. As in the quote earlier, I think that these newer methods of communication just extend and augment our communications and capabilities. We are cyborgs and that is wonderful. How do you use it, what social platforms/communication methods to you use, how often, with whom, where and when and why? I use it much less successfully than my younger brother, who in turn is out of date compared to the teenagers he teaches. I can’t even imagine how my son will use these technologies when he is older but I’m sure I will look on in awe and terror! I am not a technophobe but I have my limits and don’t manage to keep up with all the social media the way that some people do.

I am so obsessed with the ‘liveness’ of space: Oh WOW I love these sharing's below thank you for sharing :) [architecture is] everything that happens between one body and anotherBernard Tschumi Bodies carve all sorts of new and unexpected spaces, through fluid or erratic motions. Architecture, then, is only an organism passively engaged in constant intercourse with users, whose bodies rush against the carefully established rules of architectural thought (Tschumi 2004). More than this, architecture can manufacture space into a receptacle for dreams and memories, an external manifestation of our inner beings, a symbol of security' Gaston Bachelard describes the house and the room as psychological diagrams that guide writers and poets in their analysis of intimacy (Bachelard 1994, p38) Anthony Vidler talks of Poe’s House of Usher as a repository for centuries of memory (Vidler 1994, p18). We can see, therefore that through the ongoing process of human intervention, space can have a history and be experienced in narrative and emotional terms. I feel like the negotiation of the space between one body and another is fraught with emotion and intimacy, so it’s not something I do lightly.","mood":"low","lowCount":4,"midCount":2,"highCount":0,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":387,"file":"cherry noticings/Day 19: Noticings","title":"Day 19: Noticings.","created_date":"2018-02-19 22:01:30","text":"Family love is so FULL and BLOOMING.

Right now it is at its greenest with all the leaves out on the trees. We are lucky to live near trees with a wide green space beyond a wooded valley. It is here that we walk most days and it is ever changing. Each day is different. Often we are gifted by the trees, pine cones, conkers, burnished leaves, snapped off daffodils needing rescue, lost hockey balls the list goes on. Yesterday (Day 11) the gift was two fallen white candelabra blossoms from the mighty horse chestnuts. It was dusk as I climb up from the valley bottom. No-one about just the dog and I. A beautiful golden light as the sun gets low in the west. We make for the place I try to be whenever I come here especially in the mornings, so I can greet the day. It is the smooth stump of an Old chestnut which has been cut down since we came to live here, it has a still living neighbour- right now so densely leafy that it causes me to think there must be as many leaves on it as there are stars in the sky. This is my destination and my turning point. Standing on the trunk I greet the directions : East, South, West, North- only this time, because it is the end of the day I choose to reverse the order and begin with West. This is a new ritual that I love to do it is from Native American tradition and the full ceremony encompasses 7 directions- Above, Below and Within are part of it.

Explanation: I like to make soup from whatever can be found in fridge, store cupboard or garden. This has served me well throughout family life and any special soups I have done are not nearly as good. Sometimes not only the ingredients are found but sometimes the soup is made in response to a particular situation. It is a tradition that the Jewish mother heals family difficulties with Chicken Soup. Perhaps I have inherited this instinct from my Jewish forebears but on several occasions I have found it handy- most people respond to being fed some comforting soup when things are tense! Last time I did this was in Canberra when there was some tension over high grocery bills (it is expensive down under) so I set to concocting a soup out of found ingredients, feeding us all at no extra expense and restoring harmony round the family table. All this is a long winded way of saying that I will make soup, but it will come about without special planning, clothes, invitations etc. I will report back on how and when and who ate it and if it resulted in any sort of transformation- watch this space!

Such side lining-could it be due to fear of the elder feminine power ? Denial by means of not acknowledging it? I think this is so. There have been notable exceptions, but even Queen Elizabeth 1 begins her most famous speech by saying I have the body of a weak and feeble woman yet I have the heart and Stomach of a King! Women in Western Society have colluded in this conspiring, we have been afraid of our own power. So we play the roles of perfect wife and mother or career woman only to find ourselves lacking, once the time for these roles is over. The emphasis on the external has been part of the reason. So much time is spent on the look at my tits thing, lets Botox the wrinkles, what lovely cup cakes I make, that we bury our earned and learned wisdom in this trivia. Only lately has there been a re-evaluation of the role of the Elder women in society in the west with women looking again at how many tribal societies were run and deciding to not fade away. Healthy and stronger for longer we are claiming greater equality with men and being visible in both public and private life. This brings us to the crux: to uphold the feminine traits of intuition, inner knowing, nurturing, softness, nurturing all the things that make up our power, without sacrificing them to be more evident in what is still a male orientated world.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidhighhigh","lowCount":10,"midCount":5,"highCount":6,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":407,"file":"diana responses/Day 15: Response","title":"Day 15: Response","created_date":"2018-02-23 17:15:56","text":"Its working! 7 Areas for Transformation Much resistance has been encountered on this task.

Without an open and loving heart, you can never taste the nectar and pure bliss of life… If Hummingbird is your personal medicine, you love life and its joys. Your presence brings joy to others. You join people together in relationships which brings out the best in them. …Beauty is the target, and Hummingbird's mission is to spread joy or be destroyed. Hummingbird dies quickly if caged, caught or imprisoned it is a delight to have pulled this card as the first of my 7 totems. (i have a picture to insert here)Now to consider your questions: What is your lift? Like hummingbird- Sunshine! Growing plants, babies, children. Otherwise music, theatre, film, poetry, books of all sorts, and sharing time with friends and family. To a lesser degree shopping especially finding treasures in charity shops-seeking Visiting new places. Searching for nectar from all these sources. being near the sea. What is your drag? Grey skies, too much rain. Snow except for looking at. Being confined to the house. House work. Being ill fortunately I have been blessed with good health, as I can be very impatient with illness in myself or others. A stoical patient but NOT a good nurse! Being obliged to consider money. Right now as I write, Politics national and world wide. Some people, especially those who moan or have very small horizons unless they have deprived backgrounds. Worst of all unkindness. What is your thrust? Creativity-having the time to shape things- pictures, prints, gardens, cooking etc. etc. Strong protective feelings towards the family- a compulsion to meet their needs. What grounds you? Literally the ground: walking upon it, planting in it, having its support while I do yoga asanas or sit in a circle within a tipi with other women. My marriage and relationship with my husband. Morning pages- journalling each morningThe grandchildrenThe dogs How do you keep afloat in flight? By being in close contact with all those listed immediately above, grounding things which paradoxically keep me airborne. Plus having a treat in store. To quote an old friend all one needs to be up is Health, someone to love and something to look forward to. Being ON MY OWN for some time each day-this gives me time to be creative, think, meditate or simply potter. Not forgetting Radios 3 and 4 and plenty of cups of tea and warm baths- preferably all 3 together. T.V. informing, entertaining and educating. What propels you forward? Some anger at the unkindness, injustice, cruelty and disrespect for the planet and fellow beings shown by others. All the expectations and positives already mentioned plus CURIOSITY. I like to explore and learn more about, people, places, ideas. Each day surprises me with new experiences. Adaptability and Inner ResourcesI am adaptable. My childhood taught me this in so many ways. Always moving and going to different schools (7) it was a case of sink or swim. Being an only child is good for the imagination and so I can enjoy and use this gift. Enduring boarding school left me pragmatic I can deal with most things as they come along. Conversely, the restless youth has resulted in a need to feel settled -see grounding- in love and place. Yet the boarding school experience has left me with a dislike of having my freedom curtailed and the above need to be by myself now and then. My husband says I am a pragmatist to his fuss pot! Frugality-this is a double edged sword, meaning carefulness OR fear of scarcity. Overall, it useful as it ensures we are not in debt and have enough. I have found that I don't panic in difficult situations, even if I am afraid. A Spiritual seeker- I am still exploring. Access BaggageNo clear answer to this- lost in transit! I do have a deal of baggage from the past but not really any regrets. I have been able to throw off the shackles of a traditional C of E upbringing. No longer believing in a patriarchal God. I am open to different ways of looking at things if a little shy to admitting to this in certain company! The Figure 8To round this off, I quote Jamie Sams again, this time from 13 original Clan Mothers Talks with RelationsThis Clan Mother discovers how to commune with the trees by standing with her legs wide, her arms raised above. She hears the voice of an ancient Redwood. It pointed out to her that with her arms arched upward, her body created two circles. The circles formed a figure eight. The upper circle met the lower circle in her heart, with the upper one encircling the Sky Nation and the lower one connecting her to the center of the Earth Mother. It was as if she were standing on top of one circle and holding another above her, using her body as a cross-connection between the two. These are the two Medicine Wheels of life,  Redwood said. the human beings, like the Tree People, have the ability to be the balance between earth and sky… Meeting in the heart, both Medicine wheels show that heaven and earth, the spiritual and the tangible, are equal and are one… when the heart is open, all creation can be accessed and understood. & /6/17 A further Image: a disturbing oneFrieda Khalo self portrait with monkey and dead Hummingbird necklace.

They will have been married for 43 years. My mother is in hospital. We saw her last weekend. She was talking about performing a theatrical monologue when she gets out- she is learning the words. During our visit, two of the children get in the hospital lift before we do. The door closes on them and they are sent down to morgue level. We find this funny. It is the middle of a working week now, with us all getting on with our day jobs. My father in Warwickshire. The rest of us at educational establishments in Leicestershire. I find myself in a run down Youth Centre in a market town. The place was put up in a rush of enthusiasm during the 60s and left to slowly decline ever since. I am attempting to engage a group of young mothers in Communication Skills as part of an Outreach Initiative. It is hard going. We have had our instant coffee and the babies and toddlers are being looked after. A flourescent light flickers overhead, the white ceiling tiles look ready to fall on us. We can hear the sound of cars driving by outside. I wonder what I am doing here. I suspect the other women are thinking the same. Then a colleague from the next door college rushes in with a message for me. Saved. What a relief! I am to ring the hospital. Can I get there as soon as possible? No I can't. I have to wind up the group, get home, sort out transport, find child-care, travel the 50 plus miles to the hospital and arrange to meet my father. By the time we get there my mother has been dead for a couple of hours. Both of us have been elsewhere, at a distance, hard to track down- neither of us where we should have been.

My bed is an obvious nesting place where I go to roost and like to remain in for as long as I can as the day begins. Warm, secure and comfortable. We round our days with these times in our nests. As a child dens were made whenever time and materials were available. On bomb sites, beaches, in empty boats, under beds, behind clothes horses, and so on. My grandchildren do the same but they do not have the liberty to roam, so they are mostly limited to safe places like gardens and use cushions or ready made Wendy houses instead. This limits their scope and need for adventure away from adult supervision. I feel very fortunate to have had the freedom of a 50's childhood when scope to explore was unlimited, as long as one retuned in time for tea! In my childhood, Teddies inhabited miniture worlds and a small velvet piglet came most places with me in a pocket too. I still have it! Later, as home-makers, nest making took on even more significance-playtime now over and the serious business of altering houses and making them ones own… adding value, taking up many resources, thought and energy. Putting a stamp on a house. This continues and extends to the creation of gardens. Very essential to me is this engagement with plants, the soil in the outside world. Because the natural world is unpredictable, creating a garden can provide excitement whilst at the same time being a sanctuary- safe but open to possibilities/change. Gardens, houses and nests in nature are on a large schale yet the concept of a nest is of a small, intimate thing. So within these larger spaces, corners are claimed, little scenes are set up. Nest is often used as a metaphor for the female intimate parts-which I think is very appropriate. Waxed mounts of venus seem to be an alien, modern, idea- somehow making womanliness become childlike again. The link to fertility and nurture is signalled by the soft, intimate, warmth of the female anatomy. The womb is a nest in which the human eggs can grow into babies. Fundamental. Other random thoughts on nests: Nests are usually round. This is a far more sympathetic shape for people to live in. In facilitates communication as in Iron Age Roundhouses, Tipis, Igloos, African huts etc. Rectangles encourage confrontation, think Parliament or hierarchy think churches. Gorillas and orangutangs build nightly nests up trees from leaves. They are our closest cousins. Some birds decorate their nests to attract mates- usually the male bird. Insects live co-operatively in nests, thinks bees and ants.

May well send in 2 messages as it has been known for me to lose long screeds by pressing the wrong button! Here goes. Firstly, I have recently been discussing and thinking about another collection of A's. They are: Awareness Acceptance Action These are pretty applicable to most things encountered in life and onconsidering them I understand that there is often a big gap (longprocess) between each of them. Also that Action can sometimes be doing nothing or letting things be. So after that preamble I'll turn to Richo's A's and look at them in thelight of relationships as you suggest. Attention- this is indeed different from Awareness (which I prefer) as it implies getting noticed, or drawing attention to oneself. When youthful this tends to be easy unless one is shy. Beauty and being physically alluring make attracting a mate the natural thing to do. Hand in hand, with this is the desire to be noticed in education and later on a career path. Personally, this has been true for me as a young woman. I have found that as a woman of my generation, there has been a falling off in the getting attention department as one ages. Motherhood, largely without wider support, meant trimming one's sails and opting for a role which fits with family life. Once off the main path, one has to be very determined and energetic to get promotion or go for new initiatives. I have found myself too permanently distracted by family demands to have ever had that energy. Once the aging process is well underway, invisibility sets in and the only way to be really noticed is by getting nicely eccentric or needy! Acceptance: Here we are in the same territory as the above Triple A s. This is a good word but very difficult to achieve. In relation to Attention, I guess it means being contented with the situation/relationships one finds oneself in. It often implies compromise and adjusting or shifting one's expectations. I have done this not out of selflessness (although children DO have this effect) but more out of pragmatism. Appreciation: This is the up-side of Acceptance- one becomes aware ofthe more subtle aspects of loving and being involved with family, and toa lesser degree, friends. It becomes possible to weigh the qualities of people with their shortcomings; their strengths with their failing… unearthing unexpected depths in others. Very exciting and far away from the judgemental sureness of the youthful self. This leads on to Affection: Bringing up children helps us to learn that everyone from the very first second of life is unique. Part of one's own growing would seem to befeeling love for the majority of fellow humans, especially for those in one's immediate circle. N.B. this circle can change, expand, decrease according to shifting life situations. Hoping this is not coming across as too pompous! Wanted to include this quote from Mary Anne Evans (i.e. George Eliot). A friend is one to whom one may pour out the contents of one's heart, chaff and grain together, knowing that gentle hands will take and sift it. Keep what is worth keeping and with a breath of kindness blow the rest away Affection meets Allowing; Once a genuine and kind understanding is achieved between people it is possible (most of the time) to allow them to be themselves. Not to try to unduly control them, or mould them to one's will-very tempting with children- but to allow them the freedom to walk their own road. Another, pop song, quote If you love someone set them free This is of course very much easier said than done. Something I am still working on in my close relationships- the more onecares for someone the harder it is not to interfere. Very recently I have come into contact with Native American teachings and they are very strong on letting each person take responsibility so they may walk their own road. One specific teaching is about not carrying but standing beside another. I think that is enough this time although there is a great deal more I could write about the secondary questions. Not been that specific but rather general about my own experiences. Perhaps further days will do this. Don't expect such a wordy offering each time but do be preparedfor more cliches!

In response to the question how would you describe your relationship with social communications media my answer is RUBBISH. I have very little engagement with any of it. This is undoubtedly a generational thing as I find I have very little interest in getting involved with the technology. Admittedly there are some things I would like to be able to do in connection with sharing and using images but otherwise I do not have the motivation to acquire the skills needed. From observations of others involved in Facebook I'm not wishing to be part of this- generating problems and misunderstandings. It is rather annoying that it is becoming a bit of a Monopoly with event information sent out by this means only. I do marvel how anyone has enough time in the day to spend on it socially. Clearly my attitude is that nothing can match face to face human interaction. without the nuances of gesture, intonation, pause and just the sharing of atmosphere I do not believe meaningful inter human communication can take place.

I heard it on a recording of Rocking Bear a wise elder. So much to consider on this one. I'm finding it easier to think of detachment. Part 1 HeadThe closeness researched by Bowlby and Lorenz confirms the subjective knowledge held by most mothers. as in the Senegal clip it is natural to have one's children at the breast, near one during family activities and for adults and child to embrace this sense of belonging. However, there comes a time as it says in the Bible to put away childish things to create a distance between parent and child in order for the young person to become their own person. This breaking away is most painfully experienced post adolescence during the teen age years. However, it is a two way process the parent needs to allow and let go. As I have found both as a child, and a mother, this process is less than easy! This would seem to be even more difficult in modern western societies. There are few traditional rites of passage ceremonies for the young people whist financial concerns mean it is not so easy to fly the nest and set up on one's own. In what would seem an enlightened development, there has been a softening in parenting since the old Victorian extremes of feral, poor children having to fend for themselves or the Children should be seen and not heard wealthier classes. Now we are very involved with our children we tend to share their cares as well as supporting them practically and emotionally. Consequently, it is very difficult to come by the necessary distance between to allow one another to continue maturing. As parents are still working on creating this space. We love to be a close family still and to be a source of strength for one another but sometimes it is restrictive. In an effort to disentangle myself from being too emotionally involved with my daughters during their stormier years, I sought out ways of re-focusing. After all propping up another grown person is not really respecting that other's autonomy. Yoga was when I became fully aware of the idea of detachment . A cold sounding word but it is about being self-balanced and therefore more able to stand strong beside another-not swept along in a tide of emotions one can do little about. Much of the above can be applied to friendships also. Very often in the joy of discovering a new friend, or lover, there is a desire to see and be with the other person as much as possible. Obviously there are degrees to this according to the intensity of the relationship. Yet whatever the degree, there comes a time to ease off or risk becoming a symbiotic pairing with little individual growing space available. Sometimes, a friendship is lost as each person pursues their own paths, sometimes friends can come together again, changed but essentially the same, sometimes room is made for a new friend while another disappears. One of my good friends once talked about this as the ebb and flow of friendship. Part 2 HeartThis is written some days later on reflection I think detachment is in reality pretty unobtainable where love is involved. It is never entirely possible to be free of those you have loved, they call to you from the past and little shards of even lost friendships will crop up to drag up emotions good or bad. Nor is it desirable to close the heart because in order to be fully alive the heart needs to remain open. That is about it for today- sorry it is a bit of an essay!

Firstly, not finding time to get into a sufficiently back to the womb like state now so my reply will be a bit unwholistic. I have two images to share which perhaps you can add at some later date? Womb Space -ways to re connect. Mediation: this can help one attain this original space of non identity in the worldly sense whilst approaching authentic knowing of the constant self. This must be akin to being within the safe place of the mother's womb. No need to strive for food, warmth, shelter or security with just the company of another's heartbeat and a gradual, growing awareness of an exciting world out there. Similar states of awareness can be reached through music or when engaged in a timeless activity like attending to growing, living, things, swimming or creating a picture, or making bread. One reason why people probably take drugs or drink is to try to attain a similar freedom from the worldly self but I believe this is to blot out rather than to become aware. A mistaken path way. Womb Space -what it containsHindu notion of the PURUSA. pronounced Purusha: During a long engagement with Hindu thought through yoga, I have become aware of this concept which describes a certain part of the self which remains like a little light within through many rebirths. Two yogi friends add that it is the opposite of prakrti which is all matter. So purusa is what isn't matter in the world, therefore it could be defined as spirit it translates as the dweller in the city. The dweller is the spirit of the child, the city is the physical vessel of the womb. In Christian terms it is best expressed as the Immortal Soul. If one believes in re incarnation, which I do, it is the pure seed of the person which passes from lifetime to lifetime until it is enlightened enough to transcend the earthly world. It is present, each time, within the mother's shielding womb. Carrying: personal experienceOf course as the mother of four children and the Grandmother of nine Grandchildren all born by the four daughters, my knowledge of being a carrier is very deep. The experience of being pregnant is very powerful and the intuitive link with the growing child within oneself is elemental. Not all women seem to feel this, I was surprised to discover. In one conversation with a fellow pregnant woman I recall her saying It's alright for you, you feel like the Queen of the May- I feel like Dracula's mother! It is true I did feel mother earth like so perhaps that is why I had so many babies! This intensity was apparent, much to my amazement, when my daughters were carrying their babies. When there was a danger of miscarrying or termination and when there was a still birth, the pull with that unborn soul was very urgent and strong within me too. From the moment one feels a butterfly flutter from the growing fetus, the connection with the unborn swells as the belly grows. The burden of late pregnancy, the heaviness, the slowness the sleepless nights means the transition between the child being within, to the separation of childbirth, is a process of both relief and sorrow. Drum MedicineEver since the dawn of time, there have been drums. We respond to, and need to hear the rhythm that must link us back to that time we all shared a heartbeat in our mother's womb. Apart from screams, grunts, yelps or moans, incidentally all these are present in Labour, the pounding of a drum is the most basic form of non verbal communication. During this past year, I have had the shared experience of making my own drum from animal (reindeer) hide and wood (birch). On writing this, I am starting to understand why it has become a powerful medicine object to me. A group of women, worked outside to fashion their drums out of these natural materials. It was hard work, stretching and cutting the hides, encouraging one another and remaining mindful while we carried out these practical tasks. The taut skins, the encircling wood, the sinews holding the drums together are very womb like and we were not supposed to play them, except with our hands, for 9 months. At the end of this time we met together to birth our drums by making beaters ( sticks, wool and leather) and by playing and naming our drums together for the first time. I hope this reaches you Alice as I can't write it again!

Prior to that, she had been really mystified by my assurances of discretion as I got ready to ask her about something hidden that had come up obliquely last time we met. So it was ironic that our exchanges began with a misunderstanding. As it turned out the hidden thing was disclosed almost as a throw away as we set to in using an writing exercise as a communication tool. Writing without a ParachuteThis is the name of the exercise. it has to take place in a neutral place, in a cafe or similar and it is timed. Both people have to write non stop on agreed topic for 10 minutes. Then they can share or choose not to share, what they have written. We agreed on the title Being Heard. Outcome: We both share our writing and take a copy of each home with us. Here is what I notice from the two pieces of work. Both pieces draw upon elements of our informal chat, about a book we've both read, our families, she refers to the man opposite us who is drawing us while we speak. Both of us talk of children listening and speaking as new people. We make the same point about distortion: she speaks of listening Only through my censored brain. I talk of the unwillingness of adults to disclose. Our handwriting are very different but both large, untidy, flowing- 3 crossings out between us. Job done we revert to small talk again. Some overall thoughts: The meeting is a mix of informal and structured communication. Much of it depends on willingness of both of us to share, conveyed by gesture, shared observations and light heartedness.

As I still feel insecure at NOT pressing the Save button -please confirm you have got this> XXMum High Street, Old Portsmouth 1958 We have crossed the bumpy cobbled road, full of pot -holes to visit the shop across the street from where we live. It is not one of our favourite shops as the variety of sweets is limited. No gob-stoppers or chewing gum in packets with film star cards inside. For some reason we choose to come here, maybe because it is closest and we have some large brown pennies and smaller brown halfpennies in our pockets. The halfpennies have little galleons sailing across them on the tails side. The pennies have Brittania with her trident. The shop is on a corner, there is a scarlet pillar box standing there. The letter slot is above our heads. Even Bill the tallest of us, is not yet eye-level with the dark, rectangular slit that swallows letters. When Ian or I are sent over the road to pop a letter in, we have to reach up. We are outside, near the box, happily eating our sweets. Bill is a little way off but Ian and I are close together. We usually are. He is younger than I, but out of school, we play together everyday. It is summer time and so we go with our mothers down to The Hot Walls to swim. Our hair is still damp and smelling of sea weed. Other times we play long, imaginary, games with Piglet and Scott- toy animals. Like us they live next door to each other but in cardboard box houses. Some times we join with Pete, Ian's big brother, in fashioning and making war with brown plasticene armies. Most days we wander the neighbourhood. These adventures take in worming through the drainage arches of Portsmouth Catherdral and playing in abandoned landing craft in the Camber Docks. Nothing is out of bounds and very exciting. Best of all, is to climb out on the parapet of Ian's flat. This is the top storey of a tall, Georgian house . There is only a low wall between us and a fall into Old man Barlett's garage below. We can see for miles and have a 380 degree panorama of the place when we walk around the perimeter of the building. We have done this once balancing on top of the wall. But right now we are at ground level. I have to tell Ian something.

Most definitely so this is matched by feeling your own limitations. These are many. To name a few: Limited time and energy. Lack of technological know how. A tendency to get distracted and easily led off the pathway. Too many things that I want to do so unable to prioritise. Acted in alignment with your own truth ? Yes, luckily I do sense a connection to my inner truth and keep that as an anchor. There are wobbles but I have become more aware, through this process, that connections I felt in childhood have remained strong within me and that as I grow older, there is something of a return to these core beliefs. It is difficult to give examples but there is a very strong affinity to the natural world which I have always sensed. Now I am able to see this as a form of spiritual knowing. The other linked, thing is magical thinking. Much of this has been side-lined by conventional ways of looking at the world, based on fact and rationality Whilst keeping some healthy skepticism, I am feeling more able to explore these exciting and liberating aspects of being. Courage? This is a biggy as I don't lack bravery but I do lack self confidence . It is something that will always need work. I feel it most in relation to my creativity, in making my voice heard and in taking first steps into something new. All areas, besides the family, which I really care about. It is hard for me to put myself out there. Would like to be more SPONTANEOUS but find it hard to throw caution to the wind. Working on it but it is something that doesn't lend itself to the work ethic- quite the reverse in fact. Touched, tractioned and transformed your own life purpose? Another huge area. One feels that this calls for running away to join the circus, or deciding to do a marathon or to walk from Tasmania to Timbuktu. All things that are dramatic but totally unrealistic. Like the frog spawn suddenly becoming a fully made frog in one day. I have to understand that I am in a transitional stage which is at odds with being in the latter stages of life. But part of gaining life wisdom is to learn ACCEPTANCE and PATIENCE. All part of being kind to oneself. Plus if one puts this present life in a sequence of many lives- the here and now is not the end of the story.

I had to get rid of the dirt that was hanging on and making me feel worthless.

I'm in the process of moving again and this experience, being a participant in this is moving me through it Alice. I am frightened and I am hopeful and I am excited and I am curious. I have no clear plans but I have stirrings of a pathway up ahead, the clearing soon to come into view. I am making marks that are different now. I am writing. Losing time in seizures and not knowing what went on and what happened in my gaps made me feel hopeless. ‘If you take Einstein’s universe at face value – and there’s no reason why you shouldn’t, it’s our best theory of space and time – then this picture of space-time, with events placed within it, suggests something wonderful, and I think quite magical. ‘If I leave a place in space, then it doesn’t cease to exist when I’ve left it, and in space-time, if I leave an event it doesn’t cease to exist when I’ve left it. ‘So, that suggests that all those summers you spent with your mum and dad, or that first Christmas with your grandparents long ago, all those most precious memories of people and places, all those summers and winters past, and seasons yet to come, are out there. ‘Somewhere in space-time.’ Let go… let go… let go is my new mantra. This is massive – well done lovely woman. I am not there yet – I can almost do the walking away but am still ‘carrying the guilt’ – I need to put it down… I was able to walk away from those accusations without trying to make it better. I am different and that IS ok! A senior monk and a junior monk were traveling together. At one point, they came to a river with a strong current. As the monks were preparing to cross the river, they saw a very young and beautiful woman also attempting to cross. The young woman asked if they could help her cross to the other side. The two monks glanced at one another because they had taken vows not to touch a woman. Then, without a word, the older monk picked up the woman, carried her across the river, placed her gently on the other side, and carried on his journey. The younger monk couldn’t believe what had just happened. After rejoining his companion, he was speechless, and an hour passed without a word between them. Two more hours passed, then three, finally the younger monk could contain himself any longer, and blurted out As monks, we are not permitted a woman, how could you then carry that woman on your shoulders? The older monk looked at him and replied, Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river, why are you still carrying her? --This simple Zen story has a beautiful message about living in the present moment. How often do we carry around past hurts, holding onto resentments when the only person we are really hurting is ourselves. We all go through times in life when other people say things or behave in a way that is hurtful towards us. We can chose to ruminate over past actions or events, but it will ultimately weigh us down and sap our energy. Instead we can choose to let go of what doesn’t serve us anymore and concentrate on the present moment. Until we can find a level of peace and happiness in the present circumstances of our lives, we will never be content, because ‘now’ is all we will ever have.

The biggest transformation that has taken place for me these past few days was that I picked up the phone and called my Father. I made contact after 9 months of deliberately cutting him off and out of my life. WOW! The conversation was very different. I spoke from a place of compassion for myself and clarity about my boundaries. I told him I loved him but that I hurt knowing that he could not be the kind of Father I needed and wanted. I heard his pain and I heard his limitations. I understood his fear and I accepted that he loves me in the only way he knows how. He is broken and I am broken but we are putting the pieces back together again. We are doing this with care, with trepidation to a degree and more awareness of each other. This is completely amazing so courageous, 'My little girl needs a gentle touch, she needs to be gently spoon fed and then celebrated for her courage and her curiosity’ said her Father. I see you. My little girl was abandoned repeatedly and is very sensitive to loss and rejection. She in turn rejected and pushed her father away out of hurt and longing. It is not a coincidence that this was a nine month period. Gestation, nesting, transforming, soup, nourishment, repairing what is broken. That is what is sitting with me right now. This has been a truly enlightening and insightful process Alice. I would not have done this if it was anyone else. This felt right from the beginning and each step has felt purposeful. The synchronicity and the flow has been deeply moving. I have sat and sobbed and laughed and felt alive. Thank you.

I could not hide from or ignore my internal world. My paintings spoke for me. They became my anchor to myself and life. I believed that no one was really interested in my experience. I was there to look after others and to make things ok for everyone else. My pain, my grief, my rage was not interesting or valuable enough for me to share with others. So – I decided six months ago that if I did not engage with my Self, I would live lonely, isolated and only in service to others. This past year has been about remaking connections, establishing clear boundaries and learning how to touch the space within and without in a way that is healthy and relational. A transformational encounter is taking place in microcosmic and macrocosmic spaces. I am daring to put myself out there 'beside' others after going 'within' to love and accept more of myself. I want friendship, connection, love, attachment and only because I have decided to give it to myself first am I able to let it happen with an other! These are images from the space within me and the spaces in between and the spaces I work and live in. The female form from youth through pregnancy and old age are depicted here. My connections with the women in my life are very important to me. They are my tribe! My holding and gave me an experience of deep love. Fecund. Ripe. Rich. Womanly. Wholesome. Tender.

I have just decided I need to put my painting I bought from you two years ago on my alter – I called it ‘The becoming’ and I feel the same as you now in the micro and macro cosmos of life we are co-becoming together in love and trust and ‘besideness’ not as I shared with another Participant in opposition or competition or ‘horizontal hostility as it is termed…’ My paintings adorn the walls of the studio and no longer hide away in drawers. The studio wears them with pride and excitement at what will emerge next. You are one of the most sensual and sexual women I know – you gave me permission when I was at the age of 30 to be in my body… I kept slipping back out of that embodied state and retreating back up and into my head but I am still here… learning to love myself more and I have birthed two boys… none of that would have happened without the healing space and friendship of IATE and for that alone I treasure and honour you DML.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidhighhigh","lowCount":14,"midCount":6,"highCount":6,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":457,"file":"donna noticings/Day 11: Noticings.

I grew up on a little Caribbean island and spent lots of time in the sea. I loved nothing more that floating in the water and being held in the water when I was a child. I learned to swim early and my family always said I was like a little fish. When I imagine into my experience of nesting in the womb my senses and my entire body re membered floating, rocking, gliding through and the sensation of not being separate when immersed in water. It is almost a meditative experience for me and until this prompt I have not given it much consideration. I don't swim any more and I cannot remember the last time I went to the pool. I don't often have baths either especially as 'I am going through peri menopause because it is too hot for me. This makes me feel sad. As I write I feel a loss. I was told when l was diagnosed with epilepsy a year ago that swimming and riding bikes were two things i needed to do with supervision. I miss doing both and I realise that I just put them away. I spent time in Spain last summer and loved being in the water, it reminded me of Trinidad and actually thinking of it now it was the combination of the sun on my skin and being surrounded and held by the water that made me think of 'home'. I want to come home again. Is it so easy as getting into the pool and allowing myself to be held? Why have I just walked away from it? Maybe I haven't, maybe I have just used my other senses to bring this experience into my awareness. So, home, nest, womb, warmth, senses, sensation, floating, safety, containment all link with my experience of the womb. My paintings at the moment are all about water and safe spaces. Is this a connection? I am wondering about this now because for the past year I have been compelled to paint the experience of being surrounded by water, being immersed in liquid and my memories of those experiences that live in me. I have not given this much consideration but allowed myself to just follow the pull and do it. I make time to go sit next to the river and can spend hours watching the tide and the water level rise or lower. I especially like watching the light on the water and the ripples and movement under the surface. I yearn to be in there submerged and floating and know now that it offers me a sense of safety and comfort. Here are some of the pieces that I have been working on and will be showing in my Open Studio at the end of June. They have been birthed and will be meeting the world then. I am completely fascinated by the timing of all of this and the insight that I am gaining.

I have moved across the world and moved to deep dark places. I'm in the process of moving again and this experience, being a participant in this is moving me through it Alice. I was deeply moved by your courage and bravery throughout your story! I could see you jumping off the rock in Devon. I held you while you held your sister and her stillborn baby. I admire your courage to listen to your truth and to follow it. I honour your vulnerability and your strength! I am frightened and I am hopeful and I am excited and I am curious. I have no clear plans but I have stirrings of a pathway up ahead, the clearing soon to come into view. I am being birthed again! This phase of my life is challenging stories that have been given to me. I am taking the paper and the writing utensils and I am making marks that are different now. I am writing. Losing time in seizures and not knowing what went on and what happened in my gaps made me feel hopeless, helpless, like a victim and that there was only this. It also made me realize that I have to slow myself down and stop trying to please others or live for others. Let go… let go… let go is my new mantra. I have choices and I don't have to suffer. I can rest! I can enjoy and I deserve love are new and hold a different meaning. I recently let go of a couple of relationships that did not serve me or support me but made demands on me. I was attacked, blamed for causing great hurt and being insensitive. The fact that I was able to walk away from those accusations without trying to make it better tells me I am in movement and that the dirt flying off the wheel in traction is lightening my load.

I woke up this morning eager to check into Evernote and felt such excitement after reading today's prompt that I picked up my iPad and went through the house taking pics of some of my many nests within my big nest! I love making nests! I love nesting! I love filling spaces with different objects, all of which have meaning and connect with me or someone I love or some place I love! It could be one way I self regulate and comfort myself while also wanting to share it with an 'other'. It is a safe space for me and my loved ones. It symbolizes containment, holding, comfort, love, security and the perfect space for 'contact' and 'connection'. As I write this I realize that my life and my way is all about nesting! My role as Psychotherapist is to hold space and my Therapy space is full of colour, materials both organic and manmade, fabric, shiny objects, scent, instruments. It is a safe space to explore and 'be'. The physical space is as important as the emotional and psychological space for some people. I have experienced this with my clients and watched how attached they become to the space as well as myself. The safety of the nest is important. On a personal level, I know that for me it is so very important. If a space is too clinical or void of colour and texture I want to create something cosy and colorful. It is something very intrinsic in my nature to create a nest and to seek one out if it is absent. I love having friends come over and enjoy being in my space. I love watching them respond to the colours, textures, scent of oil or incense. I love preparing food, drink and listening to music while they settle in and we spend time together. This is very important to me. This past year my 21 yr old daughter moved out to live with friends while in University and that had such a huge impact on me and our nest. The impact on the space and her absence took my husband and I by surprise! I understand now why they call it the empty nest syndrome! We have adjusted and managed by creating more nesting space together. Curling up in the sofa, longer mornings with coffee in bed, spending more time in my creative nest (art studio) and planning together how we want to nest. The best part for me is when Saskia comes to visit, she wants to curl up with us on the sofa and will often request that the three of us sit up in our big bed and watch a film together. Popcorn, tea/coffee and the three of us under the duvet with a good film is the nest that we create together. It is how we get connect and affirm our closeness. I love that she can ask for it and that it leads to what she calls dmcs (deep meaningful conversations). It makes her feel loved, she feels safe and can have these conversations knowing she is nestled in with the two people she trusts the most. We enjoy these moments and feel so honoured that we are a part of this. So, yes nesting and creating nests is huge for me! I realize that even my recent series of Mindful Moments paintings are all nest like. I would not have made the connection without this prompt today and it makes sense why I felt so excited by it. My experience of losing my Mother at age 15 and my Father remarrying a year later meant that my 'home' disintegrated and for years I sought that sense of containment and cosy home feeling. I sought it outside of myself until I met and married my wonderful husband. They say that home is where the heart is and I really understand that. Edward had Saskia helped me re establish that Love connection along with my treasured friends and my nesting is about a safe space for us all! I carry the nesting instinct in me and nourish it in every aspect of my life. It manifests in the spaces in my home, my work and my creativity. Again, it is the contact, touch, felt sense of and both physical and internal space that is detrimental to my nesting process. I attach an image of one of my paintings that speaks of this. Thank you for this opportunity! It has been lovely to reconnect with this! 🙏🏼❤","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidhighhighhigh","lowCount":17,"midCount":5,"highCount":5,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":470,"file":"donna responses/Day 19: Response","title":"Day 19: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-29 21:42:42","text":"I really liked doing this prompt!

It was interesting to note my response to this maybe because there was so much here that resonated with me. I felt stuck and a little lost too. So I walked away promising myself that I would come back and sit with it when I was ready to spin the wheel. I needed to understand and in my own way make sense of the chart, diagram and the constellations. So, I gave myself the space to not think about it but I was aware that I was still holding a little worry about letting you down for not completing the week. As I observed my thinking around this and the way I navigated through the weekend I decided to read through it all again, this time making notes. The correlations and the process that was described and laid out so very clearly was TRUE to my internal and external processes. I needed to space to think and process this new information of mapping and chart. I felt the challenge to understand the image and the planets (and still do) because here was something very new by way of imagery and planets. I have never had a chart drawn up even though I was always curious. I was challenged by this! I was curious and determined to 'know' or 'understand' it better. The battle of head and heart ensued and I felt more lost. This fascinated me! This morning I gave myself the space knowing that I didn't have clients today. I could nestle into my safe space (nest) and explore, break down and make sense of my feeling, my thinking and how it all fit together. I realised that I felt stuck because I did not 'know' about this mapping and what the planets meant and I needed to know and understand so I could move forward. The wheel is moving and is freeing up, moving without mud and ready to move out of that stuck space, very much how I feel now. There are a couple of areas I don't understand and want to know more about so I will do my research and this on its own encourages me to continue use on this journey. In response to the prompts here is what jumped out at me… I saw triangles, pyramid and symbols that were familiar but I did not know or understand very well. I could not relate to these symbols or shapes and felt confused and lost. I read the information and got more lost. I felt like I'd gone into a wood and got lost in a new territory. I retreated and allowed myself time to observe myself and the process. I came back to it and organised how I would approach this. I made notes, did some research and highlighted words that resontated and that felt uncomfortable. I also made notes about what I was curious about and wanted to know more about. Then I sat with my IPad and just wrote all of this. Unwillingness to follow beaten track. Stubborn, observant, curious, need for space, I don't follow the crowd, I value personal freedom, rebellious, revolutionary., deeply offended by violence and injustice of any kind. Competitive without being combative. harmony, peace and sharing are important to me. Like to be with people as much as I like to be on my own. Battling between heart and head, indecisive, compromise too much which can lead to resentment. Self discipline can be challenging. Need structure and order to function. Mind loves learning. Resourceful and deep thinker. Notices and observes everything. Intellect influenced by feelings. Tolerrant. Can be complaining and has nervous energy… takes on too much sometimes. Can be overindulgent. Delights in sensual pleasure. Easily influenced by loved ones. Dreamer. Likes to work alone. Contemplative. Creative. Fights and perseveres. All of the above and more describes how I navigated this entire process! I don't feel stuck any more but I am more curious and want more information about a couple of areas that seem to be important to 'moving on'. This was so fascinating to map out from first contact with the arrival of this note and to my arriving at this point. I have not reached my destination but I am still travelling.

I walked in Greenwich and in stone circles and watched the City of London unfold and spread far and wide. I walked in the sun and walked past shops that called to me to go in and gleefully look at the colours, shapes and I felt the pull but I walked on past Greenwich Market and into the park and uphill to the Observatory. I felt the sun on my skin and felt my breath tighten as I walked up hills and felt the tension in my thighs as I walked down hills and steep streets. I was with my tribe and I walked purposefully in silence and sometimes in conversation. We walked for four hours and I was so present in my body and to my surroundings that it provided the energy to walk. I watched the light dancing in the trees and spent time in one of the oldest cemeteries where I saw headless angels and headstones that were pointing in many directions as the land was sinking and dipping due to the passing of years. Trees and vines climbed around and encircled these graves and stones where the names and dates were only just visible. A sense of the sacred pervaded the entire walk. On returning home to the other side of London, I rest tired and smiling knowing that my body travelled and moved and experienced this City in a new and different way. My Birth Day was the day I entered into Therapy and became present to myself. My walk today was with two women I trained with over 23 years ago on my first Psychotherapy Training. We spent time today as if no time had passed. The comfort and the sharing was effortless and so right that I realised how much of a 'turning point' that stage of my life was. These women were a part of that birthing process and today standing in a stone circle with them it reminded me of the cycles of life. Birth, Death and time. We walked in a full circle today and spent time in a sacred stone circle and spoke of the cycles that we experienced. All now in Menopause and a different stage of womanhood. I felt this was an honouring of my tribe and a family that I was birthed into. My birth family is one experience but allowing myself to be birthed into my tribe of woman is what matters to me. My daughter was conceived months after my training was finished. So much was conceived and birthed as a result of this and I honour this as A Birth Day. My name is Donna Maria LoiolaI was born in London Paddington on January 22nd 1965. I don't know the time. My mother was Julia Hill and my father David Ali.","mood":"lowlowlowlowmidmidmid","lowCount":7,"midCount":7,"highCount":0,"overallMood":"mid"},{"id":473,"file":"donna responses/Day 8: Response","title":"Day 8: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-29 16:05:08","text":"I look down at the wet sand and dig my toes in.

I see the long empty stretch of beach on either side of me and in front of me the expanse of the sea! The old man to my left is walking slowly, very slowly and he raises his hand beckoning me over to him. My grandfather with silver grey hair and dark Indian skin waits for me as I run towards him. Noone one else is on the beach yet, I see only a couple of stray dogs, skinny and boney watching us carefully. My feet make deep imprints in the sand when I run and I follow the footprints already made by grampa. I hear myself panting and at the same time I breathe in the fresh sea air. I hear the waves as they land on the beach and taste the salt of it all on my lips and tongue. I see blues, greens, browns and white in the sea as it moves towards us and away from us. I see the wall of coconut trees that line the long, very long stretch of beach and hear the wind in the branches as they sway and rustle rhythmically. My grandfather's smile makes me fill with glee. The space is vast and appears unending. I can't see where the beach ends. It looks like it just goes on and on and on. I see the clear line of the horizon on the sea . I can reach out and draw the line in the air it is so straight and clear.

I rely on it and the role that it plays for me is to 'keep connection'. I have learned to make use of it in a way that keeps me ' in touch' with friends far and near. I love its immediacy! And wonder also about how it can distance one from another and even from oneself. It is a great way to escape but also a great way to invite and use for reflection. This whole exercise for example. I waited till Edward went off to his football before I sat to reflect and write. I didn't want to exclude him on Sunday morning and to not be present with him but I felt the itch and pull to get to my IPad and this. I found myself wishing he would go quickly so I could start. It was both exciting and annoying. Exciting as I feel I am learning and uncovering so much as I go through this process. Annoying that the pull was so strong and I was being pulled away from 'being' with him. I recognize that I couldn't be doing this without digital, social media and I don't like that it pulls me away into a different space that feels more internal and exclusive than being in my surroundings. I am sat on my deck with the sun's warmth on my skin. I have music playing and I am on the computer. I love that I can do this without having to move out of my space especially as I have my physical limitataions. It has given me opportunities! It keeps me connected with myself and with you. I am so grateful for digital media, social media as it keeps me 'connected' to myself and to others. I learn through it, I communicate with it, I paint with it and explore with it. I was on the train on Thursday coming back from work and as I sat on the train, I looked around and I am not exaggerating, every single person in the carriage had their head down either on a laptop, iPad or phone. Some people had headphones on, some were texting away, some talking and all were in their own little world. I did not have any eye contact from anyone. I felt really annoyed by the insularity and felt the pull to take my phone out. I decided to just sit and watch… I wanted to see what was rising in me. I felt excluded and alone. That sense of being excluded made me want to reach for my phone and I realized I was only wanting to do so because I felt alone. I wanted to 'connect' with someone, something of interest. I felt a different sense of aloneness sitting there on a train full of people. Attention was elsewhere. It was focussed in and out via digital devices. It was not in the immediate space, environment around the people. I do it myself and know that I am cutting off and going somewhere more comfortable. I have my music, blogs, podcasts etc and they keep me interested but they also keep me away from being 'present' to myself and my immediate environment. I battle with this! I meditate to have a stronger sense of presence. I run creative workshops to help people explore their internal and external spaces and I know that pull of the digital world either for solace, connection or retreat. I value it and the fact that I can speak to loved ones in Trinidad and Brasil, I can FaceTime and see them. I can have dinner with them and discuss important issues or have full belly laughs. As I said before I love the immediacy of the connection and contact. I am also aware that it can isolate and divide. I see people in the same room on their own devices and doing such separate things. I realize that I determine how I use it for contact or seclusion. It works for both and I am responsible for its place in my life. For me, It is all about how I view it and what I am using it for. I am grateful for it! And I hate its intrusion sometimes.

The Loss of it. Slippages… I want contact! I need contact! And I want space! Embodied ambivalence. I am sat on my bed tapping away on the keypad then pausing. Long pauses, then fingers move again rapidly stopping and starting. I am stopping and connecting with my thoughts, my feelings and wanting to get it right. It is here that I get stuck! The battle in me commences. I hear the should in my head and my body wants to flow and not stop start, stop start! I breathe in and breathe out, the sound of an ambulance's siren wails loudly as it goes by and I breathe again. I see myself sat on a single bed in a small room. It is a hostel room in Kensington, very far away from the Caribbean island where space is everywhere. It is a small and clinical room. It is home and not home as there is no heat from the sun and no sound of people walking by in the streets with strong broad Trinidadian accents. I feel alone again. I know this place, this space, this aloneness. I am surrounded by other rooms all very alike and each inhabited by young women from all over the world. This is a hostel run by the Catholic Nuns in Kensington. They are everywhere and instead of feeling comforted but this I feel trapped. I don't know why. I am used to being around them. I have been surrounded by them since little. Primary School, Secondary School and Now! I have been pushed out of my nest, my Caribbean nest and landed in a cold, clinical and very different nest. I take the lift down to the ground floor and walk across the gardens to the main building where the dining room and Nuns reside. The food is bland, colourless and flavourless. Most of it is potatoe and dishes that look so bland and lacking in any pleasure. I miss my currys and stew chicken, coconut bread, red mango, dumplings and home cooked food. I am 19 years old and missing home. Home is not the house I lived in. It is the Island I love. It is the multi ethnicity, multi religious society I miss with all of the festivals like the HIndu Diwali, Muslim feasts for prayers and Mouloods that occurred with family and friends. I may have been surrounded by the Nuns and their Catholic thinking but it was diluted by the Hindu festivals, the Muslim festivals, the Baptist singing, the African Django dancing and the raw sexuality of the Carnival parties. Here in this place, this admittedly beautiful tame environment, it is different. I am different and I feel alone. I eat the food, I don't like it but I am hungry because I feel cold. So I eat! I eat and I have to buy more clothes as I gain weight and I feel the heaviness of my body and that it is moving slower and less easier in the layers of clothing. I don't want to be here. I want my room back, where I could hear the dogs running around outside the house and hear the carnival music playing in the distance. I miss hearing the rain beating down on the roof. The rain is lighter here. It wets me and makes me cold unlike the rain in Trinidad that cools me down and stings my skin when it lands. It makes noise and comforts me. The rain here is frustrating. It lands lightly touching but not touching me. I want the contact of the raindrops. I want to feel it land, make contact. Everything seems to be more refined and quieter. I prefer to hear it and feel it. This only adds to my aloneness. My mother is dead. My father is remarried and has sent me to London. My brother has gone to Toronto, Canada. We are broken up and broken down. As I walk back to my room I know that I cannot go back to Trinidad or to what was my home. I have been banished and I am not welcome back. I did not believe my stepmother when she told me this. I did not think my father would let it happen. It did! I want contact and I want space. I don't want to be alone and I don't want any contact either. I am so confused and so hungry for colour, heat, flavour and movement. My body misses the dancing, the beaches, the sunshine, the rain and the taste of the tropical island I called home. I have ended up here again. I see myself sat on my bed and my fingers are tapping away furiously. I have colourful paintings on the wall, scarves and bedding that are colourful and bright. It is raining outside and it is that light frustrating rain that does not make a sound but lands and wets everything through and through leaving a cold and clammy sensation. The skies are grey but there is the scent of incense and the remnants of last nights dinner in the air. Silky cushions are dotted around the house. I often slide my hands over them as i pass by. Flowers with strong scent sit in my space and crystals sit in the windows catching light and making rainbows in different rooms. 30 years later I am making my home my own. I can make it . I have made it. My nest, my space and contact in every sense.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowlowmidmidmidmidmidhighhighhighhighhighhigh","lowCount":15,"midCount":9,"highCount":10,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":476,"file":"donna responses/Day 20: Response","title":"Day 20: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-29 21:43:38","text":"And you have read my mind again Alice in these prompts! The biggest transformation that has taken place for me these past few days was that I picked up the phone and called my Father. I made contact after 9 months of deliberately cutting him off and out of my life. The conversation was very different. I spoke from a place of compassion for myself and clarity about my boundaries. I told him I loved him but that I hurt knowing that he could not be the kind of Father I needed and wanted. I heard his pain and I heard his limitations. I understood his fear and I accepted that he loves me in the only way he knows how. He is broken and I am broken but we are putting the pieces back together again. We are doing this with care, with trepidation to a degree and more awareness of each other. I know now how I need to protect myself and be true to my little girl. She was abandoned repeatedly and is very sensitive to loss and rejection. She in turn rejected and pushed her father away out of hurt and longing. It is not a coincidence that this was a nine month period. Gestation, nesting, transforming, soup, nourishment, repairing what is broken. That is what is sitting with me right now. This has been a truly enlightening and insightful process Alice. I would not have done this if it was anyone else. This felt right from the beginning and each step has felt purposeful.

I see how my daughter has formed her friends and the sisterhood she experiences and I feel proud of her and the tribe she has and is creating for herself. My experience of the feminine is earthy, full, loud, BIG, powerful and surrounded by love. My inner feminine is more comfortable in this body now. It is looking after this form a lot better than before. I have had to reach in to touch and encourage the wounded little girl in me who wanted to be adored and celebrated. Thank goodness my experience of the feminine in my childhood and in Trinidad and in my family was strong, soft, powerful and loving ! It is this that saved me and helped me to find a love. I love the wench in me, the mother in me, the wild woman in me. I have nourished my feminine energy and I am blessed to have a man in my life who celebrates her and journeys alongside her with glee. He has seen the witch, the kali, the frightened manipulative little girl and the bitch in me. And he still stands there with his arms open. I pushed him away once, determined to prove to myself that I was unloveable but he stayed hovering waiting for me to move through my rage and anger. He loved me through it all and still held my hand. My inner feminine has experienced great healing with this man. He makes me laugh out loud and we play together often. I am enough with him and for him. I posted some images before of the female form. I like drawing the female form as it brings me great comfort. I have clay images of women around my house so that I can touch and honour their beauty in the varied shapes and forms. I celebrate the feminine in my life and I feel so much richer for it. My female friends have taught me well by being themselves and by embracing their feminine Selves.

A nest, a place of going within, escaping from what lies outside. A space to be with my thoughts and feelings, a place to shut out the world. My spare bedroom/ dressing room is my nest room, it's full of me. Clothes, shoes, perfume, trinkets, bits and bobs… all mine and I love to surround myself with them. They have the same energy and resonance of me. A place to take my tea on the morning as I get ready for work or a place to go and read. It's important for me to have this little space. For me it needs to be a little space, big doesn't work as a nest. At times I build a nest with sheepskins for myself and John to make love. To snuggle up on the floor in our nest, to touch, hold, make love and just be. To shut out the world and allow this time together is joyous. I have a nest in the country too, a special place I go to to contemplate the world at large and work through any worries and concerns. It's my contemplation nest, full of bird song, earth, trees and animal sounds. I love nests I make them in the classroom for children when they need to be quite and restful away from the huddle and bustle. Nests are a place of safety, a place I go to go within, to reflect, to hold space for myself and my thinking mind. A nest is my place to unwind from the day and reality. A nest is a place of deep connection with myself and only I can invite people in… if I wish. I have a bedroom/dressing room that is my nest. It's full of my stuff, collections of me. My clothes, jewellery, perfume, trinkets and bits and bobs. I make a nest out of sheepskins for my beloved and I to touch and make love, candle lit and calm. Shutting the world out, our time to be alone and deeply connect to each other. Nests are more than a home or house. It's a special space. I have a nest in the woods, a contemplation nest. I go there when I'm worried or concerned. A nest to clear the mind of stuff. Sometimes I retreat to my car an automobile nest, held my it's metal to think as I drive. Nests are so important to me, shutting out the world in my life is important to me. My work nest until the summer. Creating a nest for children to feel safe, wanted and loved.","mood":"lowlowlowlowlowlowmid","lowCount":10,"midCount":1,"highCount":1,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":484,"file":"amanda responses/Day 10: Response","title":"Day 10: Response.","created_date":"2018-01-28 21:57:15","text":"They stand and hold each other for a moment.

Eyes closed, hands on heart I allow the sounds to sootn me. I find it gentle but a little amusing, loving her voice and resonating with the worlds. It stops. I get up leave through the front door and walk. I decided not to take my phone, I don't want to be disturbed but wish now I could take pictures. Maybe tomorrow I'll retrace my steps and take some photos. Walking down the street, past doors and windows that shelter the lives of others I feel my presence inside my body. I'm being born passing down the tight opening into the light. I'm stuck and find it hard to move, I'm afraid and don't like this place. I need to move. All of a sudden I feel cold, metal arms pulling at me, moving me, muffled sounds, I think are voices, calling to me. Wanting me to be born into the space of life. I enter the world in slow animated motion. My face hurts, the metal hands tear at my skin. I'm so fragile and tiny, didn't they know they would hurt me. I know I have two older brothers waiting for me, one with a big metal machine that he sits on, I like the noise it makes, it's exciting. My other brother seems gentle, calm and caring. He's going to be near me, look after me and make me giggle. At this point, I'm walking past the building I was born in. My first journey in my own physical body, leaving through these doors, into this space. St Mary's maternity hospital,… red thread factory, I was born here as was my son, and the mid wife who helped me into the world also helped my son into the world. What would it be like to re live my life from day one. Would I still travel down the same roads? Meet the same people? Would I be me? Or a different me and what would she look like and be like?? Has being stuck in birth formed patterns of being stuck in life? What allows the stuck to flow? Will it ever? Probably not. Who knows? This place is my turning point, the space it all begun, my life.

In the back of my mind I was waiting for the impact though, the car crash moment! It never came in the images but the voice was enough. Immediately I felt the pain in the pit of my stomach and remembered my brother who died four years ago. I'm not sure why the sight of the road took me to him, he didn't die in a road crash, but he loved his motorbike. Maybe this was the link. My brother died in hospital two days after Christmas Day following a very short illness of 6 days. I remember staying with him for the last 3 days and nights on this earth. Time was suspended, I was unaware of day or night, date or day. Christmas Day even came and went without a bauble or mince pie. Being in this traction was unbearable knowing I was waiting for his death. When death came so did my pain, overwhelming lose of my big brother. Pain as I had never experienced before, gut renching, vile pain that I physically felt in my whole body. I remember driving home alone from Nottingham to Melton along the post Christmas empty roads (like the ones on the video) and thinking had there been a planet shift and how life would never ever be the same again. The feeling of remembering driving to the hospital with flowers, sweets and lucazade to wish him well and how he would be home very soon. The impact of being told he only had 24 hours to live. (He held on for 72 hours)! The response of my brother who had been told of his fate an hour before me. (He asked the doctors to tell me when I got there, he couldn't tell me himself). Going to his bedside after being told… both knowing, the traction was at breaking point. The traction built until he said, it's a bastard, can you believe it, it's a total bastard! We cried, we laughed, we remembered, we drank Pear Cider until he slipped into a coma only hours before his death. I didn't go back home until the planet shift journey back to Melton. Back to the town that will never be quite the home it was. Suspended time. Void time. Time of untime. Machines going one by one… switched off, no more use! Naked one the sheets, death sheets!

As a Priestess of Rhiannon (Goddess of love, sexuality and sensuality) I have learnt to accept and love myself. Although at times I slip back into my old patterns of self loathing and mind chit chat of not being good enough. With the negative thoughts I can reflect on them now and move forward much quicker than previously. I see myself as a sensual woman who is able to love deeply, in tune with my life and being. When I really feel into that feminine place I feel me, an authentic me, powerful, desiring, fullness of one. I also have a vulnerability of a girl though who at times is scared of who I have become. I call her my inner maiden and she comes out to play, which is fun but sometimes she is naughty and tells the queen me silly stories. The queen then needs to step in and give her a telling off, thank her and put her gently to bed, in a safe and secure place. In reality I think I have only found my real inner feminine since doing a lot of tantric work. Loving myself, being able to raise my own sexual energy, just for me at times. A dance of desire to be me. I love feeling the physical aspect of being feminine, pretty clothes, make up, jewellery, perfume etc etc but I feel so I've and in my body naked, stripped of make up and jewellery and perfume. I think I am at total ease with my naked inner feminine in both aspects. Rhiannon taught me to feel deeply into my heart and feel what is really there. Unfolding the layers of stories that I have told myself over the years. A sacred famine rebirthjng into a more profound and mature me. My sacred feminine is within my core, Yoni and heart and transmits out through every pore of my body. I have just read this and it sounds rambling and messy… sorry, I hope you get the gist.

The sense of wider network it brings is a quick fix, at first comforting, a social nourishment. But like all quick fixes the loneliness creeps in when you notice your reliance/addiction becoming so gripping you can't go a minute without feeling the 'twitch'. I read this great book by The Minimalists called Minimalism which coined the term for when your body gets these unstoppable urges to check your electronic device… The twitch. ’Twitch twitter tweet…’","mood":"lowlowlowmidmidhighhigh","lowCount":6,"midCount":3,"highCount":3,"overallMood":"low"},{"id":509,"file":"amanda noticings/Day 13.

Thank you for some incredible, moving and heart felt sharing’s I feel totally privileged for your honest, vulnerability and desire to share and grow thank you! :) I wanted to summarise and share some of what arose as a collective before I post tonights new Day 2 prompt for the next 24hrs… I loved this quote from one of you it felt particularly relevant and funny! It summarises the love and humour that needs to rest between us as 'humans relating' and working together within this ‘serious’ research project so thank you… 😃 I will be analysing all responses over the 21-days in detail as individuals and across the group and with particular methods but as my intuitive summary back to you all at this stage here are some of your wonderful words as food for thought: The in-between. The interweaving nature of life. Closeness. Intimacy. Love. Anger. Loss. Splitting. Insight. Courage. Energy. Passion. Softness. Self-care Self-abuse Self-harm. Self appreciation.

The shared solitude of deeper feelings. Loss. Self-care. Self-acceptance. Situational acceptance. Solitude/loneliness. Like sperm whizzing across the countryside out and home. Duty. Death. Beauty. Anger. Pain. Drink. Syncronicity. Memories. Action as doing or letting be… Beauty. Aging. Eccentric or needy. Pragmatism.

Non attention – allows the unexpected to rise. Personal choice. Ephemerality. Respect. Beautiful selfies. Healthy attention – gaining or losing. Immaturity. Insecurity. Growth? Wisdom? Social Media. And to finish today before I post for tomorrow- a mini insight into my world: I gave attention today to my son age 13 who was ill, I had to accept I was not going to have my day alone which was hard. In order to manage my own needs too and yet remain affectionate, I gifted him with a box of ‘naughty’ treats so that I could still go to yoga and value my own space and time. After eventually getting my two boys to bed (one has again just reappeared = gritted teeth emoji) and after reading all your wonderful contributions at 22. 30 I accepted that I indeed needed a big G’n'T and to finish the box of pringles to relax… give myself over to this process too and settle in for the night for as long as it takes… A beautiful challenge thank you all and goodnight!
